an immediate and permanent ceasefire must come into force .
and I would also like to say not just for three hours a day !
the third requirement is to intensify the peace process .
experience over recent decades has taught us that peace in the middle east cannot come from the region alone .
documents received see minutes
russia !
israel must now understand that there are indeed consequences for its actions .
therefore , safety can only be achieved with an outright ban .
plant protection products play an important role in agriculture , horticulture , forestry and gardening .
finally , I would ask colleagues to support uen amendment 182 and to reject the package amendment 16we cannot prejudice this scientific assessment with a non scientific based definition .
parliament rightly insisted on legislation that would be effective and suitable for the task .
this chiefly concerns high risk substances .
our rapporteur is on the right track .
i do , in fact , have reservations about that .
we should be very strict when it comes to poisons of this kind .
the chemical industry , which agriculture needs , also has a duty to evolve and to find alternative solutions .
worse is better !
that , too , is important .
fungi unlike insects that come and go come and stay .
in the face of the irresponsible pressure exerted by ecologists , it is comforting that common sense has prevailed .
it is welcome that we have retained the three zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for member states .
i find it regrettable that we are not permitting any impact assessment of the agreement now reached .
i would like more positive thinking for the new year .
europe is showing that it is the world's trailblazer .
we are talking about a competitive disadvantage for eu producers .
in my opinion this is the basic approach .
67 % of european citizens expect a european policy to be developed in this area .
written statements rule 142 
this would give commercial channels considerable input .
secondly , how can technological impartiality be guaranteed ?
the solutions found in these countries are proportionate to the resources available .
this is the political question which we are basically required to resolve .
on the other hand , commercial broadcasters required to provide a public service also play an important role .
why ?
we require this as part of the lisbon strategy .
i should also like to say a few words about the red tape .
incentives to encourage sustainable cultivation of energy crops should not jeopardise food production .
firstly , I have introduced the principle of civil society representation into this report .
i would like civil dialogue to be based on the principles of clarity and transparency .
we agree that civil society plays an important role in european integration .
this means that the aforementioned document does not have legal force .
this all brings to mind the definition of democracy .
growth has slowed down considerably , to the point of turning into an outright recession this year .
we have made many new joint discoveries during the debate in committee .
cfp and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management short presentation 
that , however , was not the situation we found ourselves in when we began .
it also restates the directive's requirement of ensuring the independence of those bodies .
i would just like to conclude with two final comments .
firstly , regarding the issue of taxation of cross border mergers .
i therefore have no difficulty in agreeing on the need to push forward in this crucial domain .
we are aware of the different opinions .
without them , there would be no euro .
the european parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage .
after 10 years , it has to be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success .
it demonstrates the best that europe can achieve when everyone joins forces .
for those who do not , the euro was associated with price rises .
today , the crisis has changed many of these perceptions .
it has proven itself to be independent , efficient and self confident , and it acts decisively and quickly .
the idea that the ecb has done a good job is extraordinary .
there is nothing it can do .
what you have done with this euro is you have trapped people in an economic prison .
the anniversary is also an opportunity to debate whether britain's long term economic future lies with euro membership .
i would appreciate it if you would allow me to do that .
obviously , I supported my own report .
what has our nation gained ?
for us in a country with a small internal market , this is particularly important .
ladies and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away only six years stand between us .
i wish you success in your further work and in the next european parliament elections .
applause 
there is no question that we need a regulatory system for pesticides .
madam president , I too found this a particularly difficult decision .
written explanations of vote
i voted in favour of this report because the aviation industry in romania will benefit directly too .
however , we cannot support paragraphs 63 and 64 , which raise doubts about free trade in agricultural products .
the recent extraordinary surge in food prices rightly prompted a discussion on agricultural policies , food security and development .
it is also wrong for churches and religious communities to be given a special status among civil society organisations .
i insist that dialogue should be especially with associations that give a voice to the poorest individuals and families .
member states must therefore screen their legal systems and increase the clarity of the transposition process .
i still regret the fact that we dropped the 50 % objective .
undoubtedly , businesses will shed jobs and even cease trading altogether .
the meat scandals in recent years show quite clearly how easy label fraud is .
that is why we have voted against .
it is therefore disproportionate to collect and use data whose reliability cannot be guaranteed beyond all doubt .
this report does not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself .
in connection with this , the risk exists that they will be more easily falsified or forged .
this was also mentioned by some of our fellow members who spoke previously .
mr president , I also wish to thank mr coelho .
i therefore welcome the use of biometric data on passports and other documents .
this stays the same from conception to death and even beyond .
it can already be seen , mr cappato .
otherwise , party conferences would not be broadcast so extensively .
the eu does not have a proud tradition of transparency .
this is , of course , impossible .
they deserve our acceptance .
secondly , and even more importantly , the current text has benefited enormously from your input during the process .
the commission has also already made various commitments .
we hope for the support of the parliament in these political discussions and later in negotiations with the council .
so , is the negative response to agriculture unduly influenced by the document itself ?
this is very useful as this council decision makes for extremely effective sharing of dna and fingerprints .
i think I have more or less answered your questions .
the truth is that illegal immigration to europe continues .
the commission must carry on without losing its enthusiasm for this policy of cooperation and aid for member states .
since august 2007 the financial markets worldwide suffered from a major confidence crisis .
my question is do you acknowledge that the commission's regulatory reflexes were sluggish in this matter ?
but there is a balance to be struck between being overly pessimistic and being realistic .
the rapidly growing numbers of fake medicines have forced us to act .
health is one of our most important assets , if not the most important .
the information must be monitored before publication .
you have referred , rightly , to information to patients and you have dwelt on the detail of that .
that included veterinary medicines , as well as human pharmaceuticals .
we will not permit this under any circumstances .
the information must be based on data that has already been authorised by the approval authority .
professional users will only be granted authorisation after they have completed a training course .
often dichloromethane is used by individuals carrying out restoration work in their own homes .
you have played an important role in bringing about this proposal .
this occurs only with dichloromethane and not with the other substances .
the council must therefore permit the member states to ratify these parts of the convention .
the sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. 
applause 
naturally , we are also interested in diversifying the supply and transport routes .
why wait ?
your work programme outlines those goals .
well , we do not bug private discussions , as he did to members of this house .
we import 99 % of our nuclear fuels !
this will confirm the sincerity of your words .
i agree with the premise of this motto .
i call on the czech presidency to carry out the resolve expressed in the prague declaration .
in 1618 , an unpleasant habsburg diplomatic mission came to hradčany whose behaviour was unprecedentedly arrogant .
i look forward to such a political defenestration now .
their coming together is determined by globalisation and the multicultural economic environment which is still developing .
that europe gave its neighbours , including those in central and eastern europe , the prospect of accession .
its programme contains the right priorities .
the family policy that I read about in your programme is an old fashioned family policy .
it is the new generation that can understand what is meant by .
american satellite states have no place in our union .
de mr president , the catania report is a real sham .
this is something that I do not agree with and find unacceptable .
pl mr president , all children have the right to the love of both their parents .
good .
last but not least , syed kamall !
various alternatives to dcm based strippers are already available on the market .
i voted in favour of the report .
his text in fact denies the most fundamental human rights 
in my view , the community cannot applydouble standardsin its internal and foreign policy .
applying this could have consequences in terms of censorship .
in writing . de I voted against the catania report .
finally , I hope that all this can be achieved by the end of this parliamentary term .
the demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency .
this assists proper preparation for the elections to the european parliament that will be held in june 200in doing this we can really contribute towards greater transparency for our citizens .
we need to address broader and more complicated challenges .
mr president , 17 days of fighting in gaza have quite simply left a heartbreaking situation .
i should like to express my firm conviction before I conclude .
today , clearly , we must issue a strong demand for a cease fire , but this is not enough .
we would have saved years if we had respected the elections in palestine .
mr president , what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking .
there will never be security without peace , or peace without justice .
the western powers did not create two states in 1948 , but they should do so now .
we have avoided inserting an equals sign , however notional , between an existing state and a terrorist movement .
the sons of those who were exterminated have become exterminators .
it is no accident that there is a large difference between the gaza strip and the west bank .
we must consider each child's life to be of equal value , on either side of the border .
that is the first task to be carried out .
the use of phosphorus on civilians with the claim of civilisation is not compatible .
i think this is quintessential , and everyone agrees to this .
we are a major trading partner . we are a major funder in that region .
israeli troops should return to their barracks .
hamas has to stop firing rockets at israel .
if we do not have results , it will inevitably have political consequences in our relations with both countries .
i do not want to blame one or the other party .
second , we definitely missed an opportunity in 2004 when we discussed the gas supply security directive .
i believe we should react immediately and really find coordinated community mechanisms to respond to this type of crisis .
what has unfolded in recent weeks has led to great surprise .
in actual fact , they are now causing major detriment to their top customer .
the eu observers are helpless .
millions of people are freezing and factories are being shut .
by preventing gas from reaching the eu , ukraine involved us in its problem .
confrontation is not the solution either .
his political tone is too calm .
i wonder why it is so .
decision makers reacted to the turning off of the gas taps as if this had been completely unexpected .
i think we are quite successful in doing that for the time being .
what is at stake now is whether member states can move beyond the policies based hitherto on separate deals .
we need to secure ourselves against a future crisis by increasing our gas storage capability .
in writing . et madam president , honourable chairman .
the european union should never become a victim of such political behaviour .
we need a common external policy in the energy sector .
the introduction is covered by a special rule and there are no limits .
it is therefore high time that the eu entered into negotiations and introduced sanctions .
then I would like to make five short concluding remarks .
certainly , we are not a naval power in the czech republic so we appreciate here strong eu engagement .
the participation of belarus will depend on its domestic development .
reforms should look to the future and make the lives of ordinary people easier .
after 13 years it is time to bring the shameful srebrenica episode to a closure .
srebrenica stands as a symbol of horror and inconsolable grief .
this is at the heart of our eu's efforts in the western balkans .
we must not tolerate discriminatory and exclusionist stereotypes about individual nations , we must battle with collective guilt .
this resolution .
the president cut off the speaker . 
srebrenica , july 199 bg thank you , mr president .
it has marked me .
we must never forget the victims of brutalities committed during the war in the former yugoslavia .
i would also like to take the same opportunity to end my speech by making two points .
we all have the obligation to the dead not to make victims out of the living .
therefore , we have much to do on this .
we should not simply talk about a time limit .
the point is that these long distance transports increase costs which are , ultimately , passed on to the consumer .
this was an area in which we were to improve the situation .
we talk about costs .
how should this be organised , and who would provide such training ?
these are two things that cannot be equated , but to an extent we have been doing so .
the owner beats the horse .
monitoring by europe leaves something to be desired and is still very much organised at national level .
even now , the european commission refers to national reports which it will be assessing on paper .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would like to try and answer some specific questions .
however , no member state has done so .
a total of six member states were inspected in detail in 200these are some more specific facts relating to the questions that have been raised .
you have stressed that you do not have decision making powers with respect to the unesco procedure .
ladies and gentlemen , I would like to respond to one speech in particular with which I profoundly disagree .
on the subject of the resolution , my group discussed this again yesterday evening .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , everyone has agreed to an addition to paragraph voting time
our presence only prolongs the war and the resulting suffering , rather than eliminating them .
some definitions have been incorrectly transposed in 15 member states .
moreover , the only thing that this offensive will achieve is to intensify the conflict .
it is imperative that the european parliament express its views on the crisis .
the conflict between israel and gaza has simply gone on too long .
war , both civil and regional ,
nevertheless , there are signs that mr lukashenko is slowly warming to the west .
the iranians themselves must perform this task .
to this end , a 32 member national council for democracy and development was set up to govern the country .
consequently , the trade union confederations cntg and ustg became the main force in the fight for democracy .
in this case , the elections are to be held in two yearstime .
i support this resolution .
the international community unanimously declared this to be a further step towards media censorship in kenya .
many of the new member states , among them romania , for instance , have no legislation for minorities .
pl mr president , five thousand juggernauts drive through the town of augustów every day .
handicapped citizens cannot use these cards in all eu member states .
the latest information provocation is that georgia kidnapped a russian soldier .
the matter is currently at a standstill within the council of ministers .
ro given the current climate in europe , guaranteeing energy security is becoming a priority .
this is a very serious and dangerous problem and must be resolved as soon as possible .
we need a new international economic architecture .
obviously , we are interested in international trade and its development on the basis of mutual benefit .
we are seeing the first signs .
there is a danger that protectionism will increase because of the current world economic crisis .
small and medium sized enterprises play a huge part in this .
the french government has already developed a system of additional credit insurance for the clothing and textile sector .
these initiatives do not have to cost anything .
written statements rule 142 
firstly , of course , at the level of ict products themselves .
as regards funding , we have so far invested more than eur 4 000 million in this initiative .
the fact is that we need towns and cities as partners in a new energy policy .
i trust that , as the european union , we shall maintain global leadership in this revolution .
i therefore call on you to support it in the vote in a couple of daystime .
turning finally to nuclear energy , there are some very different opinions on this subject in this house .
it may also show its passivity and risk marginalisation .
my fourth point is that our strategic document greatly complements our efforts towards implementing the third energy package .
by intelligent , I mean varied , and being open to new things and not standing still .
we can now say that noticeable action is being taken by the commission in this direction .
hundreds of companies had to cease production and pay their employees just 60 % of their wages .
finally there is the matter of the nabucco pipeline .
on the third internal market package , I would just say what it does for europe .
europe , for its part , must diversify energy sources and improve supply security .
obviously this was a political shot in the foot .
the commission recognises the essential role of development finance .
these undisturbed areas are well suited to the study of evolution , of natural changes occurring in nature .
it is also important to add one clarification to the report .
so for me , promoting wilderness tourism is a mere contradiction of the termwilderness.
women are the first to contribute to inter generational solidarity , thus participating in the creation of social relations .
that being said , your comment is obviously noted .
however , the lisbon strategy aims to ensure that 60 % of women able to work are in employment .
so , what am I talking about ?
public authorities may be considerably assisted by the participation of universities and research institutes .
i also thank mrs angelilli , who has unquestionably given us a high quality report .
there is no doubt , in this regard , that children are the most vulnerable group .
on the other side , the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited .
we must make sure that child safety becomes a central issue in all eu member states .
we must be able to protect our children before they become victims .
i have raised this subject many times myself .
this , however , is a struggle against consequences .
i have noted that mr fava was hoping for a statement from the council and parliament .
that too , my group will accept .
i would like to highlight those articles that safeguard the rights of workers who have been exploited .
last year alone , there were no fewer than 12 000 in as small a country as belgium .
establishing legal penalties certainly represents a step forward .
this is not worthy of the european union .
the rapporteur suggests relaxing the union's policy towards the russian federation .
the solution for the future is a massive investment in , and development of , renewable energy .
i fully support mrs záborská's report .
i would like to see included also other cutting edge fields , such as stem cell research .
most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change .
even now , 46 % of the surface of the earth is classed as wilderness .
i am impressed with the commission's commitment to proportionality in the regulation of general and business aviation .
i voted in favour of the report by mrs záborská .
this commitment must be taken into account in particular in national social security and pension policies .
the report was unanimously approved in the committee on women's rights .
i am voting in favour of the angelilli report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
i support a lot of what the report contains and have voted in favour in many individual votes .
nothing is more important than the health , wellbeing and future of our children .
the large majority of victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation are children and adolescents .
i believe that this is a major development .
we must also do that in this case .
applause 
we are also required to effectively isolate individuals who represent a serious threat .
one is the deputy head of al qa ida in yemen , and one has blown himself up .
and this is why we must insist they be held accountable .
the prisoners of guantánamo cannot be dealt with as if they were an undifferentiated herd .
not one european government , not one national parliament , has invited us .
as the head of a police authority , this minister should pack his bags and go .
we can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the us , as portugal has done .
torture is unacceptable and there are no exceptional circumstances to alter this truth .
there is also the tactical debate .
this is one level .
it also , through the most recent legislation , sets commonly agreed standards on return policy .
i believe that it is important to give you a few figures .
they will , naturally , be relocated around the country pending legal examination of their case .
subject internet safety programme
the call for proposals will be open to all legal entities established in the member states .
vice president of the commission . as I said , he must know a lot of people .
the commission , especially its olaf service , deals with the counterfeiting of coins .
the system is as follows .
what is also important in this particular part is that there is shared management .
a completely new instrument has been introduced the so called annual summary of all reports of paying agencies .
so the situation is improving .
could you repeat the question ?
i can only pass this question to my colleagues .
but I have not been informed that we have had any reaction from the iranian government .
we could not have imagined discussing the potential radical changes in eu iceland relations .
subject demography report
europe cannot have stepchildren , since in one sense or another , all of us are minorities .
there are few political territories within the european union where a double standard is in effect .
the establishment of internal legal standards to protect the legal status of minorities is unavoidable .
romania perhaps has the most generous and up to date legislation on national minorities in europe .
i do not have another passport .
there was a palestinian exile who took latvian citizenship .
any non citizen can acquire full rights , including the right to vote , by becoming a citizen .
that has been the greatest advantage of this committee .
if we understand that , then this task has been worthwhile .
although funding is scarce , it is crucial to technology development and to maintaining expertise .
a large proportion of this feed is exported to europe as soya .
they were wrong .
the latest set of measures was the recently approved energy package .
i have here some statistics on our work .
today , we speak of renewables and energy efficiency .
twenty per cent by 2020 was a start but only a start .
devastation will come to agriculture .
we have now adopted our climate package within the eu here in parliament .
the european commission estimates that an annual investment of eur 175 billion is required to fight global warming .
climate change is bringing about broader democratic participation by society , a society which lives with different cultural values .
i am opposed to the over simplified approach towards the agricultural sector in paragraph 189 , though .
as such , we will oppose this paragraph .
it is a way of reducing energy bills , which will please consumers .
climate protection can be accomplished , but the measures need to be swift and consistent .
the transport sector must reduce co2 emissions by 20 % by 20therefore , I would like to urge states to apply tax incentives and encourage people to use public transport .
we did not get the chance to hear all sides of the debate .
the upshot of all this is the creation ofgreenjobs in new , competitive enterprises .
the european parliament has not remained silent .
i now invite you to take the floor and give your message to the european parliament .
the checkpoints have increased from 580 to 6the world declared in anapolis the failure of unilateral and military solutions .
our starting point is human dignity . palestinian girls work just as hard in school as israeli girls .
explanations of vote
making use of scientific research and using it to develop technological solutions will automatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
many regions of the world are teetering on the brink of disaster .
but I do not know whether my constituents will accept that we are actually going to make any difference .
this is problematic , to say the least .
nonetheless , some principles are absolute and ought not to be sacrificed to expediency .
they have shown the will .
climate change is a fact .
the report is very sprawling .
i therefore applaud mr fava's initiative , aimed at protecting the rights of these vulnerable people .
any haphazard decisions may be fatal if we do not pay the utmost attention .
without that , guantánamo will be followed by another poor solution .
the minutes of the previous sitting were approved 
i want to remind mr pöttering and all his vice presidents 
but you prove my point thank you very much .
with our resolution , we in the european parliament are supporting kosovo in this mission .
the serbs in kosovo must ensure that they avoid this type of situation .
eulex might be beneficial to the european union , but could this also be said of kosovo ?
applause 
therefore , romanian social democrats will be obliged to vote against this report .
this final report really is a final report .
eulex itself cannot do this job .
some do one thing , others do another .
only compensatory duties at the borders of the european union can re establish a genuine and fair international exchange .
the carmakersslump is also the result of their bigger faster heavier philosophy over recent years .
the industry is already in serious trouble .
however , in this case , 12 members requested the floor .
i realise that there are huge practical difficulties .
it is very clear .
every citizen has the right to consular protection .
i was repeatedly assured that the spanish have a consulate in mumbai and those that were there know this .
as you know , I can only accept two supplementary questions in addition to the original author's .
would he ensure that our concerns are communicated before the necessary legislation passes through the us congress ?
subject measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings
for your information , I am meeting the chair of the committee after this question time .
the others are also important , but either in the long term or without such a huge impact .
subject tobacco control and smoking cessation
i am anti smoking , not anti smokers .
what is more important the lisbon treaty or this ?
the dramatic consequences of theklausstorm in southern europe debate 
the commission would also stress the importance of moving forward on the revision of the solidarity fund regulation .
you have just told us , mrs vassiliou , that you hope to receive parliament's support .
therefore , I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that european solidarity really can exist .
it still holds the wind speed record over 250 km / h .
the second , which was on an unprecedented scale , was the storm of 27 december 199it flattened most of our forests , for the first time .
the debate is closed .
currently only two such cases are still open , but are about to be closed .
we know that this oil should not have got into the animal feed chain .
that is appropriate if we have tight controls on it .
we do not think outside the box .
why do farmers not welcome inspectors in , seeing them as protectors of their businesses ?
thus , the oil is diluted and added to the feedstuffs .
this is bad news in the current difficult economic climate .
we cannot deny that .
this is ordinary people suffering , and it is our farmers who are suffering financially .
the debate is closed .
let us take a brief look at the history .
it is a good example of parliament working .
within the european union , there are , in fact , 5 million farmers and 60 million pet owning households .
this report has been a long haul .
i believe that this regulation will encourage european farmers to promote their agricultural products .
i would like to thank the rapporteur .
development impact of economic partnership agreements epas 
it is wrong , in my view , for parliament to make promises of this kind .
we should not forget that internationalised enterprises show great innovative ability .
the eu has now taken on primary responsibility for assisting kosovo internally .
however , it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the ltte have been exaggerated .
nevertheless , the death of civilians in a war zone is tragic whenever and wherever it occurs .
according to the international red cross , the shells hit the paediatric department .
once again , who is picking up the pieces , ladies and gentlemen ?
although the government has promised to investigate the attack on journalists , that is no solution .
they are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it .
unfortunately , the thai authorities have not provided those refugees with the humanitarian assistance they so clearly deserve .
madam president , this has happened for the last five years .
fr madam president , you are absolutely right .
written declarations included in the register rule 116 see minutes
we find this unacceptable !
thank you very much , mr chichester .
the quartet will have a crucial role to play in the months ahead .
soon , most probably , there will be a new israeli government .
the population is suffering enormously .
what about jerusalem , though ?
would that majority be able to react to an election victory by integrating hezbollah ?
ind / dem . mr president , today we are debating a resolution about humanitarian aid .
the lack of drinking water constitutes no less a threat than the lack of food .
in this report , we are intentionally selective .
i shall turn now to the individual points of this report .
we then make clear statements about the capabilities that we need to develop .
the eu has been incredibly successful in peacemaking .
we have to move on the eu has to move on in its peacebuilding .
we have idealism but we do not equip ourselves with the means to reach those targets .
therefore , I would not overrate the role of the lisbon treaty .
each new eu military mission is problematic .
to begin with , resources and means .
someone spoke about helicopters .
mr president , several speakers are putting a brave face on things this afternoon .
concerning the mediterranean , we have objected to a reductionist approximation that only talks about security .
indeed , this is also mentioned repeatedly in the report by mr saryusz wolski .
how can we try to solve these problems together that of energy security , for example ?
despite the verbal outpourings in sharm el sheikh and jerusalem , nothing has yet been done in this respect .
the new administration has made a very positive start , also symbolically by the announcement to close down guantánamo .
afghanistan is also an important issue .
that could enhance understanding and also the development of democracy beyond our eastern borders .
now , of course , mr solana , you are asking for more capabilities and more aid .
i am certainly not questioning the remarkable work of the civilian observer mission on the ground .
is there progress in this area ?
i have already touched upon finance .
this is a job for the next parliamentary term .
the nabucco project must be adopted as a strategic goal by the whole eu .
mr president , first of all , I would like to congratulate ms napoletano on her report .
the model followed in barcelona has not had the expected results .
there are four requests from the chamber for leave to speak under thecatch the eyeprocedure .
regrettably , there are still several countries that have serious problems in this domain .
this decision has only deepened the european crisis .
mr president , eu funds distributed by the lottery offirst come , first servedis wrong .
the act states that the bulgarian orthodox church is traditional to bulgaria and exempt from registration .
protectionism is like a dose of cocaine for an economy .
that concludes the item .
however , let us be honest .
the barcelona process should be supplemented by the european neighbourhood policy and the objectives must be clearly defined .
how can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument ?
let me just say a few things .
time is against us .
the debate is closed .
new financing discussions will begin this year .
this is the context of the discussion about the new policy instrument that is being held here .
i came to this debate because I was anxious to hear the arguments about legal bases .
however , I remain to be convinced .
another joint undertaking , galileo , has not been established at all .
the committee on development then started drafting a report .
the report is commendable .
social economy short presentation 
participating organisations , on the other hand , are too small to become known on a macro economic level .
these will be joint events with council presidencies and member states .
i agree that there would be significant added value in periodically reviewing progress against the objectives of the pact .
it enlivened the dialogue on energy policy in every member state .
in the current report , we attempted to draw general conclusions regarding the aforementioned action plans .
there are grounds for reiterating this at a time when state aid seems to be flowing in abundance .
we want europe to be recognised for its flexibility that would indeed be a positive sign .
if we think that the commission's proposal is good , then we must support it .
of course , we on the left welcome the reduction in vat rates as a matter of principle .
mr almunia please the stability pact is broken .
however , I do accept that reducing the taxation burden is an instrument of economic stimulation .
the amendments to the directive provide for a significant extension of the opportunities for applying reduced vat rates .
the euro sceptics are anti brussels , anti frankfurt , now they are starting to be anti everything .
i call on the council to work towards this .
the same goes for some equipment for people with disabilities these provisions are heading in the right direction .
action plan on urban mobility vote 
it was approved unanimously , with one vote against I think , in the committee on constitutional affairs .
social economy 
voting time continuation 
that is not all .
we succeeded on all counts , with one exception .
what a needless waste of resources and time .
it is a valuable tool for reducing our dependence on oil .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fisheries sector .
we reassert their right to defend themselves and to remain themselves .
i am convinced that applying this directive will improve practical employment conditions within the community .
that is why I will abstain .
this is totally unacceptable and contravenes the principles of modern democracy .
i have therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
the eu can also exert a positive influence on the situation in the middle east .
yet it is not a position that europe could or should have followed .
in writing . british labour meps joined with the socialist group in voting in favour of this report .
furthermore , relations with russia must be reassessed in light of the recent events in this area .
there should be enhanced eu involvement in the black sea region and an ambitious eastern partnership .
these activities should expand the free trade zone .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
decisions concerning certain documents see minutes
i appreciate what you are saying , but that was not in accordance with our rules of procedure .
all democratic forces must be extremely clear on this matter .
neither do we need to have guards physically present in some places , especially in strasbourg and luxembourg .
we still do not know the full extent of the the economic crisis which unfolded last year .
we should remember that solidarity is most important during hard times .
we do not have to fear war , but yet we see attacks such as this crisis .
this has , I believe , also been expressed by parliament in this report .
a major problem , which required lengthy negotiations , was the situation with regard to employee participation .
the story is similar to that of the european company .
it is designed for smes .
that is included in point 87 regarding the cohesion fund .
it amounts to a revamped bolkestein .
we must promote entrepreneurial mindsets this is what the small business act stands for .
i would just like to comment on one point .
his absence is due to preparations for that .
we therefore need to strike the right balance between freedom of establishment and the interests of third parties .
suddenly , 150 employees are required in order to obtain employee representation .
perhaps the commission's proposal will be improved slightly in the forthcoming negotiations .
we must also arrive at a better definition of responsibilities in the case of people rescued at sea .
force can only be eliminated by striking at its roots .
i wish sincerely to thank all my fellow members whose significant initiatives helped make this a more comprehensive report .
if anything , it is a reason for concerted action .
in my country , which is no exception , the roma are socially marginalised and live in poverty .
4. we need to develop standards for protecting consumers against fraud , gambling addiction and the other dangers involved 
the commission has published research into the legal and economic aspects of the gambling market in 200however , this report provides some particularly useful clarifications .
that is true .
the economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible .
supporting nuclear energy or new mines in africa is not the solution .
2009 must be a year of cooperation .
pt madam president , just a brief point of order about the agenda for this week .
we therefore have to see safety in another light here , too .
we do not want to resile from those challenging targets , but to give them that stability .
madam president , I want to raise a related matter .
first of all , I would like to congratulate mr schwab for the balanced report he has compiled .
new technologies will enable us to have safer , greener cars .
that and I will put this somewhat carefully is an exaggeration .
i therefore went to some lengths to get the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs on this point .
the amendments discussed by all the groups to permit stricter controls on furan and dioxin emissions are also justified .
mr president , at the heart of this directive is the problem of control and of costing .
no one knows how much it would cost it is called the european safety net .
i find the hysteria when we deal with soil protection or the wishes of the farmersunions incomprehensible .
permit conditions are already generally very stringent .
please reconsider the amendments which are particularly damaging to it .
this proposal is no work of the devil , nor is it a bureaucratic monster .
this is something that we can talk about .
that will not happen and cannot happen under my report .
this is a pragmatic and efficient way to mainstream transparency into all our policies .
outsiders , citizens if you like , should not be given them then .
we want increased transparency and citizens must be able to follow the democratic debate .
we are speaking now about privacy in the era of the internet and not privacy as an abstract notion .
they thought I was the commissioner perish the thought !
i dare say that there are many in this house who do not fully know how this place works .
i rest my case .
you can declareadoptedornot adopted.
we have concerns in ireland about road safety issues .
it must be rejected .
you cannot bring in regulations that are destructive and make pig and poultry farmers go out of business .
these are not issues that the european parliament can underestimate .
mr president , quality food is not an aspiration in europe it must continue as a reality .
99.2 % of my region's businesses employ fewer than 49 people .
such a rare event deserves to be highlighted .
we do not need temporary procedures , let alone a host of mutually incompatible mechanisms .
the use of personal data is beneficial to public safety .
the commission's proposal is very poor .
i believe that conducting an information campaign on this issue is essential .
if the big companies fold , the little ones will inevitably follow .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
in any event , this really is a major piece of legislation , since it contains seven texts .
a consolidated framework for european accreditation of classification companies will also allow us more effective control of our shipping .
of all the major world economies , europe is the most dependent on the transport of goods using oil .
the revenues thus generated must be used to reduce the external costs .
this reinforces the polluter pays principle .
the problem , which is starting to cause serious difficulties , lies in the imposition of a congestion charge .
mr president , I want to say a word on the need to include co2 emissions in the eurovignette .
it should not be for the eu to dictate aone size fits allapproach in this area .
this includes work aimed at increasing the energy savings and efficiency of the buildings concerned .
the second question was about the young and the old , and how they can communicate better .
that brings me to the third question what about the price of the communications ?
i would recall the convention on cybercrime and its additional protocol .
we have already introduced private storage earlier than we normally do .
so please trust me that we will continue to keep an eye on the situation .
as a result , there are many different labelling techniques in operation within the eu for sheep products .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
the aim is to offer this option to parents who want it .
it is clear that governments may not cut back on public services , not even during the current crisis .
i have , I am afraid to say , heard no answer from you today on that question .
of course , life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home .
children are our future .
in addition , the number of single parent families is on the rise .
at this point , a fundamental question arises which will determine the direction of further deliberations .
childcare helps families and society as a whole , and it can help the most vulnerable children too .
if one part of the body hurts , the whole body hurts .
colleagues have raised the issues of why people feel the need to move to look for work .
the debate is closed .
i hope that the european parliament and the council will come to a rapid agreement over this matter .
mr president , I commend the priority given to this debate .
statements by the president
it means taking adequate measures to improve energy efficiency .
as for the causes of this crisis , the most important point today is to learn the lessons .
in conclusion , we must act .
our fellow citizens sometimes ask what the purpose of europe is .
applause 
these economic recovery plans will not equip the european economy to face the future .
he has lost his marbles !
you have not made a financial stimulus of 3.3 % in europe you have not !
i welcome these moves towards a more intensive approach and flexibility .
the current crisis shows that member states that responded to this request now perform better than others .
commissioners , we are looking forward to further proposals on this subject from the commission in 200it is important to emphasise the significance for a successful economic recovery of measures to support employment and business .
let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action , and not just words .
further steps are to be taken at the spring 2009 european council in this regard.
it is proposed that we should only allow the purchase of eurobonds with swedish and danish crowns .
it turns out , however , that this is not true , and that it is a bluff .
today , we have to face up to the challenges of an economic and moral crisis .
i will be really brief .
yesterday , ecofin reached an agreement on reducing vat in labour intensive services sectors , such as restaurants , etc .
i agree with everyone who says that things could perhaps have been done better .
what will parliament therefore ask of the commission ?
the latest forecasts for 2009 predict economic growth at a level of 1 % or lower .
yet in the current economic crisis , there are signs that european solidarity is being undermined .
all member states need to be involved equally in decision making .
on the contrary , openness and the spirit of competition need to remain the basis of our activities .
we must make effective use of every opportunity available to us .
the commission will only consider its proposal after the two branches of the budgetary authority have adopted their positions .
oral explanations of vote
we must also make sure that we avoid protectionism in europe .
i just wonder if this report is actually heading in the right direction .
german taxpayers and this is rarely acknowledged have always propped up the whole system .
as such , I confirm my vote in favour .
i therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation to approve the draft recommendation agreed with the council .
the current crisis is more than just an economic and financial crisis .
this is not enough , however .
however , unless it speaks with one voice , this will result in loss of credibility .
this must be a priority during the financial crisis .
this is why the effective and rapid restoration of the award of credit must be ensured urgently .
the house rose and observed a minute's silence 
what is the way forward ?
i also wish to say to mr lax that the problems with sis ii do not affect vis .
i have participated in these debates from the very beginning .
in fact , this is not just my feeling it is the feeling of the public at large .
it is not , as mr vondra said , a political problem .
therefore , it has to be said , sis ii has had to meet increasingly sophisticated objectives .
that , then , is the commitment eur 68 million .
former yugoslav republic of macedonia progress report 200let me begin with croatia .
we would like to take this opportunity to stress the strategic importance of turkey .
unfortunately , the accession negotiations with croatia are currently stalled because of the border issue .
first , the parties can choose any one of the methods outlined in the un charter .
the commission's initiative provides a very solid basis for this , and a viable way forward .
this needs to change .
there is indignation about the demonstrative arrest of the mayor of the city of strumitsa and of other politicians .
firstly , turkey is not a european country , but forms part of asia minor .
we hope that henceforth there will no longer be any reason for obstructing the subsequent accession talks .
the main problem is the matter of the name .
the only british party in the european parliament that opposes turkish entry is the uk independence party .
in fact , you could say that time is money .
that would be a good thing for slovenia , croatia , the european union and the western balkans .
turkey's opposition to strategic cooperation between the eu and nato manifestly acts against the interests of the community .
this situation is detrimental to all to the european union as well as to turkey .
these are major reforms .
the gas crisis in january has demonstrated more powerfully than ever the need for the aforementioned infrastructure .
so far , it has completed proceedings against 116 accused with very different verdicts .
unfortunately , in reality , there are not enough relatives to do so .
has any thought been given to a form of harmonised training , as these are new initiatives ?
president in office of the council . I am not among the greatest defenders of the cap .
there is the economic crisis there are those ambitious environmental goals .
it is vital from the point of view of accidents , and particularly single vehicle accidents .
if I may say so , I think that is half the question .
she has referred to the recognition of qualifications .
we know from talking to midwives recently about the difficulty of getting professional indemnity insurance .
this sector is very important .
there is a wrong figure there , and it may well not be as bad as that figure suggests .
the statistics are there .
the european commission cannot fail to respond positively to this challenge and I urge it to do so .
however , for many member states this remains a very sensitive question .
there is no equivalence between terrorists and the legitimate forces of a democratic government .
i have visited this country many times as a member of the south asia delegation .
we have to revert back to peace mediation without winners or losers .
eastern partnership debate 
they also need reinforced help to consolidate their democratic institutions , statehood and rule of law .
the gas crisis in the past months has demonstrated how vulnerable europe is in terms of energy .
this makes that neighbourhood an area of conflicting interests and rivalry .
mr president , catch the eye is a good opportunity for polemics .
this is an offer , and by that offer we are trying to bring the countries closer to us .
brazil is also a country of decisive importance to mercosur .
these relations have until now been based on the 1992 cooperation framework agreement and the 1995 eu mercosur framework agreement .
mr president , commissioner , I am pleased that we are having this debate .
i hope such a summit may be held with mexico this year .
the mexico report is a very different matter , since the partnership with brazil is yet to take off .
as regards brazil for example , the subject of partnership is being settled with more mercosur dumping .
globalisation not only brings us benefits , but it also makes us more vulnerable to global crises and threats .
mexico will also be affected by the dramatic fall in oil prices .
a lot still needs to be done , but I think the way has been paved .
i feel that the eu brazil strategic partnership is beneficial for both sides .
we have always maintained that there should be a reconciliation dialogue and that the dialogue should go on .
in my opinion the paper contains some elements that could provide the basis for future talks .
it is a principle that has served us well .
he said ,we must build a great wall against separatism.
the isolation of tibet must stop for the inhabitants , for tourists , for journalists .
china has not been singled out in any way .
voting time
croatia should be allowed to accede when it is completely ready .
thank you .
i am not in favour of mr milošević he was a baleful and wicked communist .
their educational prospects are hugely diminished because they are the water bearers , if you like .
for this reason , we must pay particular attention to the pegi system for rating games .
last night , mr tannock and mr van orden argued for the complete opposite .
this proves that immigration is a human drama which creates inhuman situations .
no progress has been made with regard to religious freedom , despite the new law on foundations .
nor should the importance of research be underestimated in finding a solution to water problems .
we could not support this resolution in the final vote because these amendments were accepted .
it is clear that this is not the answer .
the new government must respect the constitutional order , deal with conflicts peacefully and thoroughly investigate the murders .
foreign attempts at mediation have been repudiated and eventually ended .
human rights are violated on a regular basis .
but , from time to time , they have flared up and there has been a flare up very recently .
most unsettling is that the majority of the perpetrators remain at large .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
as president obama said , it is not acceptable to put that many people's lives at risk .
parliament's committee on foreign affairs called for european military intervention a number of years ago .
what is more , there is little clarity about what the objective of such an intervention would be .
a war against the people of southern sudan has been going on there for decades .
we must take their concerns and needs seriously .
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
dates of forthcoming sittings see minutes
they remain vivid memories for many people who , today , are eu citizens .
texts of agreements forwarded by the council see minutes
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
the built heritage of verespatak roşia montană has also been destroyed and its population impoverished .
the resulting shortage of labour poses a threat to the economic development of the eu member states .
the first public hearing is due to take place on 31 march .
this is exactly why it is more important now than ever for us to stand united .
thank you .
i would like to hear the commissioner today reassure us on a number of points .
there are two differences with respect to the cariforum agreement .
please allow me therefore to name some of the most important points .
the economic partnership agreements seek to guarantee continued trade and development in some of the world's poorest countries .
some critics would rather talk of lost customs revenue than of the potential for new trade .
i think , on the contrary , that we should be pleased that we have achieved so much .
the epa signed with the cariforum states provides an example but definitely not a template .
i have heard them and I have listened to them .
interim agreements are goods agreements aimed at preventing disruption of acp trade and promoting gradual integration .
this is something which I believe you have taken to heart and that you are working extremely hard on .
a few weeks ago , I attended the most recent regional acp summit in guyana .
i share some of those criticisms .
of course , it is up to individual nations how they involve their own parliaments .
i have to say we are always looking for any flexibility we might have within that too .
let me turn to a separate issue , which is the resolution .
i know that sometimes it is against his beliefs with regard to trade .
he is for open trade so it is not easy for him to come to an agreement .
mrs roth behrendt has already spoken on the subject of nanotechnology .
we are happy that our prohibition on cmr substances has been retained , but made more appropriate .
secondly , the continuing financial and economic crisis may , unfortunately , worsen the situation facing african countries .
i hope that we will get there .
we must be very aware of that .
the presentation is closed .
the presentation is closed .
achieve growing bilateral benefits for an ever increasing number of citizens
active dialogue with citizens on europe short presentation 
providing information is our responsibility and our duty , whereas decision making is the citizensright .
combating female genital mutilation in the eu short presentation 
the mass immigration that has taken place in recent years has brought this tragedy to eu countries .
this has no effect on the capacity of a european country to welcome incomers , rather the contrary .
the urban dimension must become mandatory .
i would like to thank everyone who assisted me in drafting this report .
this may help also to overcome difficulties in implementing cohesion programmes .
secondly , the lack of uniformity as regards the regional models of organisation of the member states 
the president cut off the speaker 
hence I regret the passing of that programme , particularly since nothing comparable has taken its place .
territorial cohesion is not meant to focus exclusively on regions suffering permanent handicaps .
i also approve of the allocation of additional funding for improved internet access in rural areas .
we really must concentrate on the tasks in hand .
it is important to us that the sexual and reproductive rights of women are recognised .
let a thousand flowers bloomwas , I think , the great phrase .
we do not just want to listen to one side of the argument .
this has happened to me in this case and it is something that I did not wish for .
we voted for an alternative resolution , however , in preference to the original report .
we need to take responsibility for them , just as we do all other indigenous peoples .
i therefore abstained for these two reasons .
this report needed to criticise abuses of this nature instead of tacitly approving them .
nihil novi nothing new without the common consent .
let us teach our citizens to make use of the benefits offered by the eu .
the report calls for the commission and member states to work together to harmonise existing legislation .
i think that language learning will combat discrimination and support integration of the counties of a united europe .
development of a comprehensive european strategy for regions with specific geographical features 
the eu institutions and member states should do more to support such schemes .
welcome , prime minister , to the european parliament .
they talked of a hard , long and bitter cold war .
the initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from europe .
now we must implement our recovery plans vigorously .
the european union now has a framework , provided by the commission , to address this issue .
applause 
thank you very much for this , mr brown .
so let britain be a positive partner , cast in the european mould .
however , I am convinced that the problem lies elsewhere .
you cannot continue to build this european union against public opinion .
at today's valuation , that would be usd 10 billion higher .
it was not just the fact that you got it wrong , because we can all get it wrong .
we had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world .
europe did lead the way .
statements are being made that would have been unimaginable a year ago .
parliament wanted to exercise its powers fully , which was not possible at the earlier consultation procedures .
members of parliament introducing reports on behalf of parliament are shortened without notice .
this is particularly evident today with the financial crisis and the resulting restrictions in access to investment loans .
at the same time , we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing .
that is what mrs stauner was hoping for .
mr president , I want to thank all the members who have spoken in this debate .
i agree with all those members who have asked the banks to do more .
the main focus is results and not so much how they have been achieved .
with a good administrative system there is a clear division of responsibility .
congratulations !
i would like to do the same .
we want to make the abm / abb management tool better , not extend it over two years .
in addition , all the eu finance ministers must at last make a national statement of assurance .
all three institutions must find the political courage to do this together .
we must get to grips with this .
these include climate policy jobs and growth and foreign and development policy .
what strikes me is the fact that almost eur 5 billion from the 2008 budget remained unused .
it is not our current parliament that will carry it out .
flexibility alone is not the solution to the problem .
just allow me to give you an example involving money from the solidarity fund .
a number of member states have introduced scrappage incentives to stimulate demand .
it is now time to act and to implement these plans in full .
i would like to look more closely at general motors .
we need to support those people engaged in the car industry .
i expect community policy to take account of that .
all of this is being provided by the eib .
in addition , military no fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another .
however , we should not only be concerned about improving functionality here and now in the current crisis .
the airlines have blatantly exploited this in the current situation the crisis , plus bad winter weather conditions .
its profits are set to drop by 12 % .
faced with this data I have launched an inquiry by the directorate general for energy and transport .
to conclude , I am grateful to you once again .
the commission will not hesitate to make a legislative proposal if the industry does not introduce a voluntary agreement .
strict , standardised regulations are certainly needed , as some member states are already using external service providers .
let me deal with nanotechnology first .
we must be consistent in the political message we send to the commission and to citizens .
if some people are concerned about nanotechnology , then they should be able to make a different choice .
it is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
we must not allow the foods in question to be open to misleading consumers .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for what she said about animal cloning .
substances that deplete the ozone layer recast debate 
the uen supports this regulation .
consequently , I totally agree with additional measures being taken to limit or even ban ozone depleting substances .
opening of the sitting
we agreed that all of the short term measures must be temporary and that is how we view them .
it has put the brakes on investment in renewable energy .
you said that geithner's way is the wrong way and leads to hell .
applause 
i personally feel very sorry for you .
if we cannot agree on our common cause then we cannot hope to punch at our collective weight .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
at the summit eur 5 billion was also allocated to the anti crisis package .
roosevelt heavily attacked the oligopolies , the big companies in the us , and reregulated the economy .
that is winning the economy and it is winning the hearts of citizens for europe .
there is a great difference between proclaiming fine words on a street corner and putting them into practice .
berlusconi did that before the last elections and I have no wish to repeat his mistake .
i have already mentioned the stimulus packages .
we are not under time pressure from day to day to come up with the new regulation .
i think it would be good to say something about the eastern partnership .
mr barroso , you said that we are doing well we are investing 3.3 % .
well , the calculation is simple .
unfortunately , I do not believe that the czech republic alone is to blame .
that dogma is completely wrong .
another point is the solutions for eastern european countries and countries that are not in the single currency .
this must also be the outcome of the meeting of the g20 countries .
this must not be allowed to happen !
the european central bank will have an even more important role .
that is an arrogant statement .
and , most importantly , the crisis is no excuse for protectionism .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy projects and broadband internet .
determined to do what ?
now we are waiting for a response from the six countries which have a direct interest in the programme .
ec cariforum states economic partnership agreement vote 
before the vote on amendment 2 
i should like this to be recorded in the minutes .
this issue is still regulated on the basis of the 1944 chicago convention .
it is not a manufacturing industry , although it does create some jobs .
our approach to industry during this economic downturn must be holistic .
i think it is important to address the performance and sustainability of the aviation system .
the reports dealing with thesingle european skyinitiative are therefore following the same timetable .
so there will be noblank cheque I abstained .
in the automotive sector there is an enormous potential for moving in a green direction .
the report's second objective is to strengthen cooperation in practice .
i believe that this strengthening will benefit both parties and also the international community as a whole .
when we agree , we can set the terms of the global agenda .
thirdly , afghanistan is a key issue for both europe and the us .
in the commission we are all working very hard to contribute our fair share to our common reinvigorated agenda .
this will then set the scene for a successful eu us summit in washington , probably in june .
this report is not only about enhancing transatlantic relations but also about balancing them .
the report we are dealing with today recommends a strategic enhanced partnership and the process leading to it .
it obliges americans to obtain an international guarantee of immunity before participating in united nations operations .
instead we need a resolution on how to proceed over the fundamental issues affecting the world today .
that is certainly true .
we ought to take advantage of that fact .
we cannot fail .
good news !.
they are now responding .
for example , we are now being asked to provide greater strategic input on afghanistan .
interim trade agreement with turkmenistan interim agreement with turkmenistan debate 
in particular , some political prisoners have been released , and there has been increased cooperation with the un .
since the regime change in turkmenistan , we have increased our cooperation in this area .
articulate clearly any figure that is mentioned .
so , between these two extremes , what should we do ?
we know that negotiations are under way , but they are not completed .
it is not a question of advocating turkmenistan's isolation , but of engaging with the country .
well , we should take two pencils , one in each hand .
the president cut off the speaker 
as for dialogue with belarus , this is necessary , but not at any price .
it is about values more important than party differences .
i , myself , am a historian .
europe's conscience cannot be clear without fully examining and remembering the past .
yes , it is necessary to investigate and justly condemn the crimes .
it is not a matter for academic study .
the europe of today should remember the victims of 20th century totalitarian regimes worldwide .
in russia last year , stalin was voted one of the 12 greatest individuals in history .
communism must be condemned with all the means at our disposal .
democracy has provided freedom of thought , expression and movement .
the hungarians in romania , the people I represent , are such a case .
that is a symptom of having been sent to siberia .
even at that time , the west capitulated morally to the soviets .
last but not least is the question of where the debate should lead .
the idea that problems can be eliminated by eliminating people is one of the principles of stalinism .
there are many different kinds of fanaticism .
it is feasible .
i would also like to express my thanks for the support I received for my amendments .
their proposals weaken civil rights and the privacy of citizens .
up to the present day , the internet does not forget .
it is a new arena for the exchange of opinions that is sorely needed for political mobilisation .
the security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the internet .
i truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry .
laws must apply to the internet as they do everywhere else .
let me read , in particular , how balanced we have attempted to be with this report .
mr president , I thank the commissioner very much indeed for his opening statement .
with regard to last year's resolution , it is important to add the following five points .
we agree that measures must be taken to ensure full compensation of those victims .
theopt insystem guarantees that victims affected by the infringement of competition law will actually be compensated .
there is not much I can add , except perhaps on the legal bases .
documents received see minutes
madam president , commissioner , the food aid programme is essential today .
the programme has helped one in six of the people in need .
and all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality .
that is not the point today .
such liberalisation has always been to the detriment of fragile populations , fragile producers and fragile areas .
we have consistently said that this is an extremely complex issue .
the commission should not make the same mistake again in this case .
applause 
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the report by mrs batzeli .
thus I support the call for an investigation into the margin share in the production and distribution chain .
it is a corrupt scandal .
we serve nobody by failing to recognise that essential point .
it is a shame that president pöttering does not somehow follow your example in so many ways in this .
i share the opinion expressed in it that it is important to preserve freedom of expression .
many points are worded in a long winded way or duplicated .
in writing . due to a conflict of interest , I abstained from all votes .
i feel that the powers in question should be immediately transferred to euskadi .
moreover , the statements and pronouncements by the new us president himself leave no margin for doubt .
i would prefer to abstain from the vote on the motion for a resolution on an ec turkmenistan trade agreement .
i hope that it will receive the support of members .
it also gives a purpose to cultural tourism .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting see minutes
we are grateful to janusz onyszkiewicz for his report and the recommendations made in it .
we call upon russia to respect the principle of the independence of the written and electronic media .
it is not didacticism that is needed , but justified criticism .
i must underline that I am very , very disappointed by what is in the report .
there is nothing more important than freedom , health and life itself .
it is not enough just to criticise , or regret , continuing human rights violations in russia .
i agree that we need greater trust and understanding between the eu and russia .
this report highlighted the new strategic interest in the arctic region .
we fully recognise the growing strategic importance of the arctic region .
this means either extending existing legislation or adopting new legislation .
any measures will have to be applied in full compliance with the international law of the sea .
the european union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy .
as it is for the united states , the arctic should be a strategic priority for the european union .
in addition to unclos , there are a large number of other relevant international and regional instruments .
the call for a responsible approach towards the arctic is an sos and an issue of global governance .
i remember that we sat together on article 13 hearings all that time ago .
a wheelchair user or a guide dog user should have free access anywhere within the european union .
it is possible to raise these things , even if one is committed to fighting discrimination .
this proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity .
anyone valuing freedom of choice for parents will not allow this freedom to be curtailed .
the use of the institution of marriage cannot be accepted in any way other than in the christian sense .
it was no easy task .
if anything , on some points my concerns are the opposite of mr mauro's .
we have accommodated you throughout .
discrimination is a serious problem in europe and beyond .
the revision of the european social fund regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately .
this is indeed a considerable sum .
it will eliminate the delays in implementing the fund's aims .
the same poll also found that parliament inspired the most confidence in the respondents .
the advances , in particular , could be paid out in full at the start of may .
the joint debate is closed .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
i trust this success will be maintained during the remaining three months .
we have often emphasised how our culture is enriched by its diversity .
no other european citizens have ever had their right of free movement so grossly violated .
national consultations with slovak citizens took place on 28 29 march .
how many were there ?
did fishermen cross their path ?
these rules will also be applied in a more harmonised way .
this is a brilliant example for the rest of the house .
this is dangerous for all the other road users .
what I am advocating , however , is a clear , predictable , reasonable system .
mrs lichtenberger reminded us of the importance of these provisions for road safety .
that is all I have to say .
mrls alone do not protect consumers .
thank you again to all colleagues and the commissioner for cooperation on this report .
i am delighted that there is such a broad consensus on these issues .
allow me to explain , therefore , where the commission's immediate priorities lie in this connection .
the commission sets great store by the complete , correct application of the directive .
this approach , therefore , is not the right one .
the issue here is something very important european citizenship .
the commission takes the view that it is high time there was a specific policy programme on european citizenship .
i urge parliament not to sit back and do nothing .
i welcome the fact that the report specifically mentions the roma .
it is positive that agreement can be reached at first reading .
the compromise proposal for a regulation on the ecolabel will help to remove these doubts .
romania's parliament palace consumes as much power as a town with 20 000 inhabitants .
this requires unambiguous criteria , of course .
if it is in it , it must say so , and what it says must be correct .
in my opinion consumption is the fundamental characteristic of the consumer society .
special attention to be focused on smes .
in addition , the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather .
parliament did not agree to accept the oral amendments 
we did not have time to discuss these documents adequately , however .
before the vote 
i think it has much merit .
applause 
this will help better cultural exchange and cooperation between the eu and third countries .
but the principal reason why I abstained was because this turns the whole principle of jurisprudence upside down .
i believe that this report by mrs buitenweg is a perfect illustration of this .
unfortunately it also imprisoned history and its documents .
we would like our history to be accessible .
those steps undermine the territorial integrity of georgia as insisted upon in the relevant united nations resolutions .
we need to strengthen european citizenship because it is the central plank of freedom of movement .
this is why the rapporteur is introducing a new concept of intra community migrant , a species that is proliferating .
that is why I have voted in favour of the buitenweg report as a whole .
however , this resolution has no impact on the legislative process .
in writing . russia remains an important strategic partner for the eu .
the annexation of sovereign georgian territory cannot be brushed under the carpet , either by russia or the eu .
no update has taken place .
i voted in favour of the report onbetter schools an agenda for european cooperation.
the continuous training of teaching staff and the introduction of modern teaching methods are extremely important factors .

de mr president , mon 810 was approved in the european union in 199it was subsequently approved again in 2008 and then , a few days ago , it was prohibited .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
this message is directed to the european commission so that it can take the necessary initiatives .
in the official police report filed the next day there was no mention at all of the incident .
i beg leave to delay the house and thank you for this opportunity .
it is time for us to take stock of the situation .
my objective has been to create an agency with greater independence and decision making powers .
the discussions and proposals demonstrate that parliament shares the policy objectives and wishes to vigorously improve current performance .
but that would hinder and damage all the things that we can achieve by an open electricity market .
the targets for buildings with zero net energy consumption constitute a significant part of the reworked directive .
furthermore , in some countries the cost of installing and operating mobile phone networks is higher .
some of these means are even suggested by the regulation .
so it is a great day for europe and a great day for european consumers .
transparency is vital to the functioning of a market .
it is a great moment which shows to citizens that meps are taking them seriously .
how we should regulate it is a matter which we can still discuss .
i would like mr łuckiewicz to accept our thanks on behalf of the court of auditors .
no more small , creative projects ending up being ridiculed in the euro sceptic press !
this is the discussion about tolerable risk .
we must start now .
in the case of the latter , 2007 was actually its first year of operation .
we can only be delighted at the record levels of implementation of contracts and payments under the edfs .
the council is responsible because it is losing interest it is not here .
the member states are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour .
that is sometimes rather difficult and , particularly during election time , occasionally hard to represent .
i would like to make the following points on the latter two agencies 
we have fulfilled our duty today .
like the financial crisis , pandemics , climate change , immigration and serious crime , fish are alter globalists .
in recent years women's dignity and calling have taken on a new dimension .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 200written statements rule 142 
agenda for next sitting see minutes
amongst them is the issue of management of risk .
for several reasons , administrative burdens hit smes harder than bigger companies .
that is one insight .
conflicts of interest have been overcome there will be no advisory services in addition to credit rating activities .
frankly , I think you are going to get on really well with each other .
that is ultimately the way to make a statement .
there is no incentive for those who could change these policies to do so .
let us therefore make a start with new financial morals .
the directives that are being discussed today are important and , in my opinion , balanced .
it would appear that in official communiqués not a word is said on this subject .
i have to say that without their work and their help , we would not have achieved this .
let us hope that we can get that back .
the proposal on the table today concerns one of the core values of the union , namely solidarity .
this is not a codecision procedure .
applause 
before the vote 
we should not be choosing to come to strasbourg at all .
this is what we should also be aiming for in the case of tyres .
this is something we do not agree with , and we also voted against it at committee level .
the tools ?
i should like to point out the following in this connection 
those are the reasons why I oppose paragraph 17 of the mcguinness report , which is otherwise problem free .
energy efficient smartmeters will also be introduced .
traffic noise , of which tyre noise is an important component , is a major cause of ill health .
the reason for my abstention is not complicated .
nuclear energy will have a vital role to play in the future of energy in our societies .
i therefore voted for this report .
in 2009 , it has already been announced that 225 will go .
that would be absurd .
we on the committee on budgetary control are nice people .
the third reason is the respect and the preparation for the lisbon treaty .
now we shall be conducting an election campaign where things are being shifted to brussels again .
i now come to the third text in question access to the international road haulage market .
i too could not agree more .
the thwarting has been fierce , which is very bad news .
the legislation is therefore not just bad in times of crisis , it is also symbolic .
london taxis are also known for their quality .
some say they want to see restrictions , whilst others say we have far too many restrictions .
the recently submitted commission proposals will complete this legal framework .
among these , those who use inland waterways represent just a small minority .
in other words , we must take great care .
as I see it , one issue is now almost in perpetual motion in this connection .
so first the service and then compensation for delayed services .
europe is not the preferred destination amongst our own people .
this is a public health emergency for an ageing population .
subject state aid to non eu european countries
article 61 of the eea agreement is closely modelled on article 87 of the ec treaty .
it is still premature for any assessment on how and if the member states will follow these recommendations .
subject communicating with citizens
so I definitely share your views on doing even more to mobilise citizens .
this is something that we will do in cooperation with the other institutions .
of course we will try to do that as quickly as possible , not as part of the campaign .
session musicians will benefit from a permanent 20 % levy .
commissioner , have a rethink , rework the proposal and come back !
that is out of all proportion .
i shall just refer to some of the issues raised .
rapporteur . mr president , I should again like to thank colleagues for their contributions to this debate .
written statements rule 142 
mr president , first of all I should like to thank mr savary for his work .
european citizensquality of life depends directly on making urban transport more convenient and greener .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
we have to make motorists act more intelligently .
this is illustrated by such statistics as 
extensive use in large urban areas of telematic applications , which combine transport issues with information technology and telecommunications 
we have also increased the permissible funding level for additional infrastructures from 10 % to 20 % .
if we cannot manage to shift anything now , then we really do need to question the entire programme .
the debate has demonstrated relatively broad agreement across the political spectrum .
they should not have to go to court in order to achieve it .
we therefore warmly welcome the forthcoming debate .
it would be a good idea if this were looked at again .
any form of gender based discrimination whatsoever practised by healthcare facilities , insurers or state officials is unacceptable .
that is what we are talking about here today , mr president .
furthermore , the proposal is superfluous . for the reimbursement of costs is already settled .
i myself am a beneficiary of cross border health care .
i would like to ask two particularly political questions , since it is decision making time .
those patients who want to travel are , in fact , quite few in number .
let us not waste this opportunity !
sv mr president , the whole basis of this report is wrong .
i would refer to the dutch model of dispute resolution in healthcare that was launched recently .
in the meantime governments have lost further cases with their citizens .
therefore I do not support the proposal to create 27 definitions of specialised and costly care for this purpose .
you social democrats want to force people to request prior authorisation .
why are you doing this ?
i am delighted that the juri committee has welcomed the proposal to increase legal certainty .
it will require a significant and coordinated effort from the eu and the member states at all levels .
unfortunately , what we can do in the context of the draft directive is limited .
this means that its budgetary impact will also be limited .
i believe that the european parliament and the council share similar views on this matter .
the rarity of these diseases creates challenges both from a scientific and an economic viewpoint .
patients who suffer from rare diseases this has been said need european support .
we should therefore reject amendment otherwise , it will be highly problematic .
millions of patients in europe are watching us .
the vote will take place in a few minutes .
2007 discharge frontex 
applause 
intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport and interfaces with other transport modes 
action plan on urban mobility 
however , that does not mean we must rest on our laurels .
the euro sceptic argument I do not expect will have much traction in this house .
you recited it very well .
to take advantage of those health care services is a positive step in the right direction .
i am therefore pleased that parliament has granted its approval to this report .
making buildings more energy efficient would also have a massive positive impact on carbon emissions in the eu .
i am convinced that making car manufacturers the scapegoats for climate change is a deeply flawed and counterproductive policy .
it would be naïve to ignore the role of eu regulation in the current crisis afflicting the car industry .
otherwise we will fail both the passenger and the operator .
they arise from the very nature of this sector , which is dominated by micro enterprises and smes .
it is good that the text has been toned down in this respect .
our high quality and safety standards in germany must not be compromised .
it is no surprise that , only recently , tory mep dan hannan advocated a privatised approach to healthcare .
it will result in the dismantling of national healthcare systems and will drive out patients looking abroad for healthcare .
this public signing will help to emphasise the importance of european legislation to european citizens .
it must be one of the key priorities of the eu to press for the completion of these agreements .
you know our rules of procedure as well as I do , mrs berès .
commissioner , I beg you .
we should give them realistic messages of hope .
only through coordinated action can we successfully overcome the effects of the global economic crisis .
it is important that these operations are coordinated .
this happens probably when the road to chişinău passes through moscow .
it should be obvious why this analogy is not valid .
therefore I cannot accept the assertion that the council is not paying enough attention to bosnia herzegovina .
it amounts to nothing less than a complete political , economic and social transformation .
a much more mature approach is required .
i know that in this process we can count on the support of members of this parliament .
i must say that there is a great deal of sand in that serbian engine .
the citizens , like their politicians , want to be able to travel freely .
the people in the country need to do their own work .
the report passes over all that in silence .
bosnia and herzegovina simply cannot be allowed to remain behind .
the debate is closed .
this topic has particular importance for the eu , two of whose member states possess nuclear weapons .
however , europe cannot sit passively by while moscow and washington discuss its strategic future .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 200written statements rule 142 
at this moment we must of course applaud the 7 states that have ratified the convention .
the debate is closed .
that concludes question time .
from a political point of view , though , this change is of the utmost significance .
and most importantly can the effect be extended to non energy related products and to all products ?
this choice must not contribute to creating extra burdens on the weakest companies , thus handicapping their activity .
there is no way that the commission would support such an idea .
the construction industry does need a regulation after 20 years of having the directive in place .
all that is left for me to say is thank you all for this constructive and useful debate .
we have done a constructive job , and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination .
improved rules and greater transparency are crucial .
however , what is good enough at home becomes unacceptable once you cross the border .
the vote will take place tomorrow , friday , 24 april 2009 , at 12 noon .
it is far more difficult to include other new products .
thirty two per cent of british muslims report being subject to discrimination at airports .
this kind of profiling is a waste of resources .
so we are talking here about effectiveness as well as civil liberties .
the parliamentary delegation , too , was a strong group .
written statements rule 142 
previous parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication .
the document also outlines how to improve the defence of consumer rights and remove obstacles to business .
we reduce information costs by having a common currency .
the joint debate is closed .
the commission therefore gives its definite support to the common position .
unfortunately , however , very little has happened in the last five years .
the debate is closed .
mental and physical pressure is used to force the members to stay in this camp .
since then iraqi forces have started a siege around the camp .
but , first of all , we call on the iraqi government to lift the blockade of camp ashraf .
i challenge anyone to ask the high commissioner if any refugees have been transferred at any time .
madam president , I would just like to make two brief comments .
situation in bosnia and herzegovina
25th annual report from the commission on monitoring the application of community law 2007 
you have seen that we have tried to deal with these matters quickly , because they are important .
i hope that this will set a precedent for other areas .
we need to step up our controls in this regard .
this change has led to a fall in prices and greater competition on the payment services markets .
nanoparticles have a high surface area and significant surface energy , which give them the following characteristics 
needless to say , I completely disagree with extending the application of theblue cardsystem .
this parliament may ignore the wishes and lamentations of the european citizen , but I certainly do not .
thank you , madam president .

wednesday 
this is a matter which should be considered in the next parliamentary term .
although not all of the criteria have been met , the direction being taken is clear .
thirteen per cent is not only an unlucky number , it is a downright disgrace .
various activities took place on the day , at which we weighed up our activities in the eu .
we are all familiar with the stories about mistreatment of women by the taliban .
but we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events .
fr mr president , I should like to address the commissioner in order to voice my concern .
de mr president , commissioner , thank you for being here and for getting here so quickly .
i assume that there is a misunderstanding between the shadow rapporteur of that group and mr cocilovo .
the commission's proposal also allows member states to set maximum levels for such benefits .
that is why the commission does not recommend that these amendments be approved .
therefore , the commission cannot accept amendment 6first of all , let me underline the great importance the commission attaches to this proposal .
written statements rule 142 
of these , 24 were concluded at the third reading following successful conciliation .
the council did not want to put an end to the opt out .
why should someone not be allowed to earn overtime if that is what they choose to do ?
it madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the failure of the working time directive was inevitable .
they , however , remembered what certain meps have forgotten .
madam president , it is really bizarre that the council should blame parliament for the breakdown in these talks .
on the contrary , it was the council at its coreper session that approved those proposals .
i would like to explain one thing .
in writing . hu madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
the definition of night work is also of great practical significance .
i think we should not confuse working time with driving time .
the debate is closed .
mexico has banned the trade .
once again I would like to emphasise this very clearly .
the regulation has been supported by many eu citizens , who are sensitive to the issue of animal welfare .
both industry and animal welfare organisations believe this is necessary .
the european union should be working towards this goal .
thus far , we had succeeded .
lessons can and must be learned by all concerned in order to avoid such occurrences in the future .
consumers often pay for the services of these consumer groups before deciding on a purchase .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
as you heard , four rapporteurs have been working on elements of it .
in this directive we have significantly improved the rights of consumers and users in the electronic space .
indeed , this text does not promote creation .
it merely provides for widespread policing of the activities of internet users .
we need judicial control before net access is blocked .
these are practical matters that are important to the individual consumer .
i think that this project represents a considerable advance .
above all , we must protect intellectual property , but not to the detriment of consumersinterests .
in order to succeed , many different interests need to be weighed up and a good balance found .
improved competition must be central .
while we are on the subject of data packets , let me turn to the issue of net neutrality .
we want a judicial reservation , a judicial decision on fundamental rights .
rapporteur . madam president , firstly I would like to thank everybody who has participated in this debate .
however , 1992 is some time ago .
firstly , increasing energy efficiency is the quickest and the most cost effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
there are , however , two points that I must strongly oppose .
come on commissioner , please !
member of the commission . madam president , it is difficult .
marketing standards for poultrymeat 
i am not sure whether congratulations are in order for mr cashman .
as the president in office said , there is no opposition here to the european project .
it shows that trade and animal welfare are compatible and we should rejoice in that .
funding for non animal testing alternatives must not dry up .
we have protected the seal and this is good .
yet , despite that , we manage to provide value for money .
it is a missed opportunity .
during the debate in the committee on transport I introduced two amendments , which affect all transport employees .
the european commission's text is a nonsense .
the development of these alternative methods requires a budget .
in writing . sv this report recommends the amendment of an existing directive on ship source pollution .
on all these points , the modernisation of europe that has been undertaken bears parliament's stamp .
we cannot allow ourselves to slow down the pace of our efforts .
we have shown that strong and credible targets are possible .
my group follows that logic .
but can I remind you that an unemployment level of 11.1 % next year is 27 million unemployed people ?
a democratic and firmly european ukraine is key to a democratic , reliable and law abiding russia .
they believe that europe will do this better than their own member states .
we do not want a return to nationalism .
he is a committed european and a man who understands what it is all about .
i think that is important for the future .
protectionism is for sure not the solution .
the march european council decided on a more restrained format , to my great regret .
those who lose their jobs must be helped to find another one .
lifelong learning is also very important .
mobility is important , as stated at the workshop in prague .
europeans often ask what we do here in the european parliament , what good we do for them .
much is now contained in this report which will be passed during this parliament's final plenary sitting .
we can only hope that the council and the commission will also take these demands seriously .
signing and implementing an agreement for social progress and employment would be proof of this political will .
what level would the minimum wage be pegged at ?
i declare myself in favour of a social europe .
we need to invest to give workers the skills to work in that new economy .
in writing . in a few days , european leaders and stakeholders will meet at the employment summit .
europe has to take this opportunity to reduce unemployment .
the next item is question time b6 0231 / 2009 .
this is also partly the answer on using tax policy for creating jobs .
the first question was interconnection .
any power production , especially from new energy sources , cannot function if there are grid issues .
the european investment bank is very active in this process .
there are plenty of opportunities .
in what ways is the commission working to prevent the growth of protectionist tendencies in its international trade negotiations ?
this is an important component that we should factor in .
the commission's concerns have been put forcefully to the canadian authorities for quite some time now .
like mr martin , I am a supporter of this free trade agreement with the republic of korea .
i was recently in amsterdam and watched klm dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check in .
i would maintain that the commission does not have to systematically bleed the other four fifths .
we cited as our grounds ageing and the economic cost .
you turn a deaf ear to all our arguments this is absolutely incomprehensible .
this brings me to my final comment , madam president .
at present in diyarbakir there are more than 185 minors in prison .
mr president , our civilisation is a civilisation which uses animals .
is it possible to protect an animal which we are going to kill ?
yes , it is possible , mainly by sparing it unnecessary suffering .
the committee members were of the opinion that such a ban would be unworkable .
in slaughterhouses , official inspectors perform food safety controls , mainly on carcasses .
that is a rather sensible improvement to our procedures .
i will wind up there .
for our group , the most important point is , however , proportionality .
this report was actually split into two .
i had grave reservations about the amendment that was submitted in the committee .
i think that is a reasonable quid pro quo .
these languages must therefore be recognised in the state , and the state must ask for this .
we have therefore made provision for a safeguard in any case .
it was and is always a pleasure to work with you and with your colleagues in the commission .
it is very good .
this is a good sign .
the joint debate is closed .
in my opinion however , the projects should include energy connections between poland and germany .
it has been a pleasure to work with you all .
these are the very areas where the credit crunch is biting hardest .
we have now gone through a global financial meltdown and it is continuing to cause us problems .
we have banks that aretoo big to fail, as the catchphrase goes .
mr president , I am standing here with mixed feelings in my last debate in this house .
will a special fund be set up at european level ?
the whole world , including european countries , would suffer .
i hope I have never given the impression that I did not .
it is an accusation of a serious criminal offence .
i give it to you briefly .
cfp repeal of 14 obsolete regulations 
it is now at the heart of a european parliamentary democracy unimaginable in 197together we have advanced parliamentary democracy in the european union and beyond .
the european parliament and national parliaments are now partners .
the work was completed successfully .
we are committed to the dignity of every human being .
our work has provided a good basis for the newly elected parliament to build on .
mr president , you have tackled many activities in your two and a half year term of office .
my group and I consider that you have fulfilled your duty with honour .
you not only acted politely but also took corrective action when necessary .
and you were always gentlemanlike .
renewed social agenda 
i will read it it is just a few sentences 
i am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time .
this abstention does not concern all other delegations referred to in the same decision , which we support .
one month from the european elections , that is a strong sign .
internet users are customers , but they are also citizens .
however , we believe these decisions are best determined by the member states .
this is not a problem , as many seem to think .
budget restrictiveness must remain a guiding principle for us as elected representatives .
i particularly refer to the proposal to have all slaughter at slaughter facilities .
we have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support .

conclusions of the un conference on racism durban ii geneva debate 
these examples demonstrate our collective commitment to work on this issue both internally and more widely with partners worldwide .
compromises have been reached .
things look very bad for respect for human rights in many countries worldwide .
in our view , the civil rights campaigner , hu jia , must be released immediately .
however , the role of parliament is proving a little more difficult to find agreement on with the council .
that is a real shame in all senses of the word .
we need to make progress as quickly as possible , while ensuring that speed does not compromise quality .
clearly , effective legal protection is a fundamental principle .
europe cannot turn its back on its commitments to countries that once were recklessly exploited .
the principle of mutual recognition , the cornerstone of mutual cooperation , is very far from being satisfactorily recognised .
is the council aware of the responsibility that it bears at this time ?
now both the upper and lower houses have voted to approve the ratification .
the stabilisation and association process remains the overall framework for the european perspective of the western balkans .
i have three very short supplementary questions 
el mr president , I thank the president in office of the council for his reply .
speaking about the treaty of lisbon in this house is not a denial of democracy , rather the contrary .
this is behaviour that is neither credible nor forward looking .
they represent the results of intensive consultations between the members of the convention and ngos committed to democratic policy .
however , these methods can only be agreed once the vice president and high representative has taken office .
this is an excellent idea and one that I can only welcome .
first , I thank johannes voggenhuber , a veritable cornerstone of our work for democracy and civil rights .
as regards the dehaene report , I would once again like to mention the transitional period .
it is important to remember that .
it builds up democracy and makes the governance of the eu more representative , efficient and effective .
and we have not yet come to the end of the road .
it should be complicated .
nl mr president , mr dehaene's report gives me mixed feelings .
but we have plenty of time to come back to that , should the treaty indeed come into force .
it seemed for a while that it might not happen .
could I thank , first of all , all the rapporteurs of the five reports .
they are just advertising the rift that exists between the political class and the people in every member state .
when you talk about democratic accountability , let us not forget one thing .
applause 
moreover , anyone who says that a neo liberal economic constitution is being established has not read the treaty .
mr president , one issue that feminism has had an ongoing discussion about is that of the stay at home mother .
mrs oviir , your fan club has stayed to the end .
situation in the republic of moldova motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
this is my last speech in the european parliament .
we should therefore support this sector , which is still in its infancy .
it is good to be back for what is my last week in this parliament or any parliament .
after 25 years of elected politics that is an adequate sufficiency , I think .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
mr president , I would now like to round off both this speech and my work in this parliament .
just not by me .
it is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions .
we have managed to do that .
perhaps on the last day there will also be a bag of sweets .
in short , this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances .
this is a commitment we have made there are legislative measures being discussed .
yesterday , with theyesin the czech senate , we took a huge step forward .
it is therefore the opinion of mr pöttering only that shall prevail .
i will read amendment 2 aloud .
before the vote
i hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible .
this is a way to broaden cooperation .
the sovereignty of a parliament is shorthand for the sovereignty of the people .
we have 646 members of parliament in the united kingdom .
in writing . the european parliament has no role or responsibility to implement the lisbon treaty .
prior to that , the draft constitutional treaty was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands .
this report welcomes the new powers that will be given to the national parliaments by the treaty of lisbon .
madagascar
that , and that alone , is what we need to resolve .
if we were debating that epa today , we would have to enter our reservations regarding madagascar .
i can remember in 1993 the visit of the then newly elected president albert zafy .
we cannot keep silent and we are calling for a return to constitutional order .
madam president , 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan european picnic on the austro hungarian border .
at first , hugo chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world .
today millions of people are working illegally .
we are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in venezuela .
this same sector considers that the government is showing an intolerant attitude towards criticism .
we are conscious of these facts and we are closely following the political situation in venezuela .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity see minutes
mr jerzy buzek
the candidates have informed me that they consent to their nomination as candidates .
i want to see a diverse europe in which every citizen receives protection .
between 1997 and 2001 I was the prime minister of poland .
for four years we negotiated poland's membership of the structures of the european union .
i will make sure that , together , we will do everything we can to change this .
applause 
election of vice presidents first , second and third ballots 
his death comes after 15 british soldiers were killed in the past month .
mr president , put the numbers on the screen so that we can all see them .
i will do everything to convince you that your decision was the right one .
i would like to give notice that I shall not be indulging in any philosophical or political analyses .
from now on I will eschew grand words and pathos .
applause 
mr president , allow me , first of all , to congratulate you on your election .
prime minister , you personally have done a good job and gained a great deal of respect .
i would also like to stress the importance of the eastern partnership initiative and its implementation .
we should therefore stop this awful campaign and tell the people of ireland the truth .
the icecap in the western antarctic is melting at an increasingly fast rate .
it is our task to answer them .
nonetheless , the institutional framework is important because it defines what we can do and in which areas .
this dream makes europe strong .
it is a question of political will , mr reinfeldt , mr barroso .
you will see that in a few seconds my six minutes will be up .
this is the question of ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
the nordic countries in particular have a lot of good examples of an active labour market policy .
thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval .
the council of ministers must also realise this , and I would therefore ask two questions .
president barack obama gave an extraordinary speech about africa in africa the other day .
written statements rule 149 
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
at the same time , however , we cannot simply move on to the business of the day .
however , I think that we must hold it within the right framework .
democracy cannot be imposed by such means .
nl may I start by warmly welcoming the new president in office of the council , mr bildt .
i am grateful for this debate .
the people's republic claims that it does not seek territorial expansion .
china's problems stem in this instance from the greying of the middle kingdom .
this is deplorable .
that need is something that I , too , very much want to stress .
resumption of the session
nato and the european union are both affected .
such aid is particularly important in the context of developing trust and reconstructing the country .
the primary responsibility for managing the crisis obviously lies with the automotive industry itself .
this strategy means that it is necessary to take a leap forward in terms of automotive technology .
opel has had problems .
let us make it real !
brussels cannot just criticise germany or other governments .
previous speakers have already talked about this .
we are dealing with people and with jobs , but also with whole regions .
my party is in favour of cars , as mr verhofstadt , too , is aware .
unfortunately , it is my impression that the commission has adopted a passive attitude in this case .
it is very important to ensure that state aid leads to a proper restructuring .
does it intend to directly cofinance anti flood and anti erosion works to avoid new disasters in the areas affected ?
i also think raising awareness and fostering a culture of prevention are fundamental .
fi mr president , the past year has been one of the most tragic for forest fires .
most of this financing should go to the prevention of fires and floods in southern europe .
the eu cannot take responsibility for matters that are subject to national decisions or for any negligence that occurs .
we need a european policy on forests that seeks both to raise their profile and to prevent fires .
this , too , will provide an opportunity to examine issues relating to forest fires .
the community's solidarity fund is a sound and valuable financial management tool .
thirdly , does the commission intend to ignore the fundamental objections raised by european engineering unions ?
therefore , there are big winners in keeping world trade moving .
we must therefore find new sources of funding , not least by reforming the current system .
worse still , these resources will not arrive quickly enough .
nothing justifies a reduction in public development aid .
the issue of international governance has already been discussed .
i would like to emphasise the regular control of finances both by donors and recipients of funding .
several members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions .
many countries have a long way to go to balance their public finances .
we want to tackle head on the challenges posed by climate change as well .
at this point , I would like to thank the representatives of the political groupings .
otherwise we run the risk of falling prey to the absurd .
the budget for poseidon , the operation currently under way , is eur 11 million .
it is money down the drain .
we must ensure that frontex does not simply become a mechanism for keeping people out of europe .
is this really advisable ?
in fact , yesterday , a turkish fighter plane threatened to force a frontex helicopter to turn back .
the second point concerns the readmission agreements .
this tendency to externalise issues ultimately allows europe to free itself from its responsibilities .
can the council and the commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the italy libya one ?
today or tomorrow .
the criminal networks that exploit people's desperation must be tackled .
it is important to emphasise that our strategy must be based on multiple elements and initiatives .
the commission and council must show more resolve in providing the necessary funding for frontex .
ec china agreement maritime transport operations accession of bulgaria and romania 
i hope that we europeans can take a stronger position in copenhagen than is currently the case .
in the near future , a very difficult election will be held in ukraine .
we are responsible for speaking up clearly at this point and we must do so .
why am I mentioning this ?
until now , we have only been equal , but we would like to be more equal .
this does not mean , however , that europe is equal .
citizens of the european union very often receive entirely different remuneration for doing the same work .
applause 
i would also like to thank you for your personal involvement in this matter in ireland .
for me , the choice is clear .
i want europe to keep its world leadership in financial services .
the first test case for such a social impact assessment should be the revision of the working time directive .
in the guidelines , I emphasise the importance of services of general interest for our european model of society .
i am committed to making my contribution to european parliamentary democracy .
we are indeed living in very exceptional times , times of uncertainty and power shifts .
there is a real danger that our achievements in european integration are called into question .
we welcome this because europe can only be built in a spirit of openness and of consensus building .
if I had been a head of government , I would also have elected josé manuel durão barroso .
it is about the direction of europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
we know what you are like !
because we have a system that makes them completely crazy .
for the simple reason that it is about having more and more , and still more , more quickly .
is mr barnier going to get the internal market ?
in this case , mr barroso is the wrong man for the job of president .
but it is possible that I have got this horribly wrong .
so maybe I got it wrong maybe you are the right man .
you have modified that in what you have said to us today .
that simply will not work .
i read president barroso's political guidelines with great interest .
more and more people are saying nothing good comes of europe.
good luck , president barroso , and success in your work .
these members will support you tomorrow .
mr kelly , I am sorry but this is a new procedure but we have to apply it correctly .
we are going to weaken you in front of the member states.
there is a contradiction there , so let us be honest about it .
of course it is a compromise , but europe only works as a compromise .
and yet that is , I believe , what needs to be done today .
it is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger .
as many in this chamber have said already today , it is actions and delivery that count .
institutionally speaking , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
i wish you good luck and success in your work .
it is true that the crisis is putting the member statesbudgets under pressure at the moment .
you , mr president , know this best of all .
you can count on me at the commission to be uncompromising in my defence of the european interest .
that is the european position .
that is why I have called for a new social ambition .
for this reason I support mr barroso's candidacy , but this support is not a blank cheque .
subject eu priorities for intergovernmental conference on climate change
but the discussions in the united states are ongoing .
we must come up with specific solutions for specific situations .
however , in developing countries this demographic increase is particularly large , with social and economic consequences too .
can I ask the commissioner if she would consider a thorough and full examination of the food promotion budget ?
the sitting was opened at 09.05 
firstly , rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measures to support the financial sector and the real economy .
our goal is for the pittsburgh summit to make progress on guidelines for financing global climate measures .
for that , political will , decisiveness and courage must not fail us on the contrary .
we must also take employment into consideration .
europe has begun to put in place effective regulation , but europe must not find itself isolated .
guiding principles must be affirmed .
neither is a wish list for solving the world's problems frankly likely to win the day .
firstly , we need more europe .
secondly , we need more state .
finally , we need a better market .
many members have raised the issues that both I and the commissioner have looked at .
in summary , naturally the g20 summit cannot solve all the problems that we have discussed .
in order to do this , we need international cooperation .
why ?
in fact , however , fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the eu strategy for the baltic sea area .
getting to grips with the environmental issues is , of course , one of the main priorities .
our aims and goals in this respect are clear .
the aim of the strategy for the baltic sea area is not to create new institutions .
the high visibility this provides for the strategy is extremely welcome .
no , this is wrong .
the development of transit corridors and communications networks will stimulate business and create new jobs .
fi mr president , the european union became aware of the baltic sea issue quite late on .
it is important that we take the strategy forward and thus also implement it .
the president cut off the speaker 
some members , mrs krehl and mr itälä , have raised the matter of resources .
it could readily assume a model function for other european macroregions , like the danube basin .
it is not such a bad idea , is it , ladies and gentlemen ?
the european parliament has just sent out a signal that europe is strong and has a strong leader .
therefore , with confidence and hope , we can advance towards a europe of greater prosperity and solidarity .
the europe of the 12 , of kohl and mitterrand , is no more and will doubtless never return .
once again this summer , forest fires have devastated the south of france .
we must show solidarity with our colleagues and help the countries affected .
well , the european union gives the impression that this agreement has to come about come what may .
that is excellent because it works against smuggling .
there you have it .
it is not in their interests .
it is very important that the three countries are now given visa free travel .
will the council ?
when a position of principle is at stake , a person's religion and ethnicity do not matter .
we must be particularly mindful of this .
macedonia , serbia and montenegro have definitely taken the turning for the european union .
but it actually does the contrary , because this law may well foster ignorance , taboo and stigma .
what does that actually mean ?
this proposal is currently under discussion in the council and parliament has submitted a positive opinion .
it is up to the commission to judge whether a member state is meeting its obligations under the treaties .
would you be in favour of opening up this whole area of challenges to your own offspring ?
i would say it is about the equal value of all people .
i hope that parliament will be as unified as possible in voting in favour of this resolution tomorrow .
the voice of non governmental organisations also fell on deaf ears .
question time council 
the other question was about what robust scientific data is in place to show the need for this .
subject child trafficking in the eu
now the world situation looks a little bit better .
it touches upon the conference itself but it is , of course , something that goes much further .
in difficult economic times , the authorities must take the action required to promote economic activity .
el madam minister , I appreciate your willingness and determination to give clear replies to our questions .
we will be cooperating closely on climate issues ahead of the copenhagen summit at the end of the year .
an appropriate regulation would be needed for this .
tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas .
european policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment .
after this crisis , that is what the debate must be about .
the livelihoods of dairy farmers are under serious threat .
for months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history .
this has to change .
hu mr president , emergency measures are obviously needed , as the situation is disastrous .
we have already reserved eur 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year .
they all agree .
but quotas alone will not save the dairy sector .
longer private storage scheme for butter
energy security nabucco and desertec debate 
a large concentrated solar power plant will be inaugurated this month in seville .
why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision making processes ?
commissioner , you said this is not part of our strategy for security of energy supply .
over the next few years , electricity produced from solar energy will become significantly cheaper .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with commissioner piebalgs .
europe's energy security is based on a variety of sources , routes and supply countries .
i also want to highlight countries such as egypt and libya in terms of gas supplies .
pl the european union needs suppliers whose business dealings remain transparent and who fulfil their obligations .
this is our overarching goal .
the only solution for overcoming these challenges is to persevere with the appropriate measures .
i therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace .
is there no limit to our presumption ?
let me make my position absolutely clear on this .
this is therefore a huge tragedy .
that , I think , sums it all up .
the commission also has to look at diversifying energy security in the various eu member states .
that is why we voted in favour .
around 700 000 homes were left without drinking water .
the taiwanese authorities did not have access to meteorological information indicating how serious the typhoon was .
therefore , I would like to ask the commissioner the following question .
we also welcome the chinese assistance .
there is much we can do .
we can speak the truth .
that has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs .

i would like to make one more important comment on the irish referendum .
composition of committees and delegations see minutes
i do not believe that problems of this type should exist when we have tragic situations to deal with .
protests 
when we debate something , we must subsequently vote on a resolution so that the debate serves a purpose .
fr mr president , we wish the following phrase to be added to point a 
for results and other details of the vote see minutes 
it all depends on the czechs .
the treaty of lisbon is not the end of the story .
mixed reactions 
that is not democracy .
es mr president , this parliament is the palace of the imagination , the palace of dreams .
our citizens want a clear and substantive answer .
they want us to speak forcefully on matters to do with climate protection , security issues , financial regulation .
i expect you to take this extremely seriously .
the eu commission intervened continually interfered in the process .
he is hopelessly compromised by going around with the chief executive of one of the biggest corporations supplying transport .
i became a catholic in ireland .
i am just sorry to see such a massive landslide .
this time the result was 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
it saddened me because I believe that the eu has been a force for good in the world .
i was a committed federalist even in the period when the czechs and slovaks shared the same state .
ireland does not want to be associated with british euroscepticism . dublin is not london !
can I assure them that he does .
in addition , these are people who will never be in the council of ministers .
i have consistently opposed the federalism of the lisbon treaty and the ceding of powers from nation states .
i shall repeat what numerous members have said .
i think we are all of us to blame for that .
the institutional coherence and balance of the european project is at stake .
it is certain that in this matter , much will depend on the citizens of europe .
the people answeredyeswith a two thirds majority and with a higher turnout than last time .
it is not a question of his good will or his inclination it is an obligation .
we wait with hope for the final ratifications of the treaty .
captain camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return .
i wonder , therefore , what the council is intending to do about the fisheries agreement .
please come and exercise the solidarity that has so often been mentioned today .
not even those who committed war crimes during the balkan war have been given such stiff sentences .
the crisis in the sector requires appropriate instruments and I believe that these will be used .
thus , we would contribute to the security of passengers who use airlinesservices .
i would like to ask the commissioner for a reply .
the debate is closed .

european newspapers , including the french magazine le nouvel observateur , are also threatened .
our group feels that media pluralism is not just an italian issue .
alas , the title of today's debate is italy .
what fine freedom fighters !
today , parliament has a unique opportunity to bring out and reveal our most positive attributes .
uproar 
half an hour later , the ambulance arrived to treat mrs niebler .
we are still waiting for them .
. nor are responses from the authorities .
freedom of the press is a fundamental freedom enshrined in article 21 of the italian constitution .
that concludes the vote .
that is happening in this case .
what I do strongly oppose , however , is the federalist tone of various amendments .
it is for this reason that the commission proposed the mobilisation of the esf in favour of italy .
the role of eurojust is also not clearly defined .
i am sure that they are a step in the right direction .
on the one hand , the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job creating growth .
the greens had negotiated the joint motion for a resolution and obtained satisfaction on many amendments .
nonetheless , they have not signed the joint resolution so that they can make a scene in plenary .
together with the other countries of europe , we will be able to overcome the challenges we currently face .
dates of forthcoming sittings see minutes
the italian parliament has just proven that it is independent .
a large number of meps , from four different groups , have signed an appeal along these lines .
these tv repeaters allow the reception of catalan television in the valencia region .
i would like to tell you that there is no legal basis for an eu policy on sport .
so that is the first response .
clearly , I can only be in favour of a much more active role for parliament .
this fact assigns the commission functions which , in my view , are not justified .
i would therefore urge the commission to take note of the criticism expressed here in this chamber .
my country , austria , is particularly affected , due to its geographical proximity to the eastern european states .
consequently , I emphatically support the rapporteur's efforts and agree with his proposals .
there you have it I am grateful to parliament and to mr busuttil for his cooperation .
secondly , we are not throwing open the doors at random .
at the same time , our services have stepped up the governance and monitoring of the project .
i would like to ask the commission why there have been such delays and overspending .
in his political life , he has always shown himself to be competent , serious and a true pro european .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
the commission is not part of the solution to the problem , but is actually the problem .
experts in development will also take part in the negotiating work .
developing countries are the most vulnerable countries to climate change .
man made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics .
the efforts and views of parliament are crucial to this work .
it is not a london auction in which our task is to outbid each other .
secondly , we must take the two degree target seriously .
fair enough , but then it should be ensured that the existing funds are topped up .
the developing countries are now suffering a triple blow .
time and time again I have heard members here talk of co2 as a pollutant .
it is a life giving natural gas .
one hypothesis is that the global temperature will continue to rise .
i therefore call on the commission and the council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in copenhagen .
the development of such technologies is a vital component of our strategies to achieve our climate change targets .
at copenhagen , we will see 27 countries acting as one to achieve ambitious targets .
however , we cannot limit ourselves to this .
nor must we forget that climate change will require the contribution of science , technology and economics .
the european union plays an important role in , and assumes a commitment to , funding the climate programme .
this is the key to europe's climate change policy and its copenhagen objectives .
we must progress further along this road .
mr president , the scenario is the same .
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
this has already been debated in the g20 and many other forums .
currently , there is no coordinated renewable energy strategy on both a european and world scale .
consequently , I voted to reject the commission's legislative proposal .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
president of the commission . thank you very much , mr kamiński .
for 2009 as a whole , that would represent a 4 % decrease .
it was not a great result just 67 % of the people !
that is a decision for the european council .
does national democracy matter , or is the european union , in your opinion , a greater good ?
i would also like to thank mr barroso .
that is 16 % of all new jobs .
secondly , why do we keep meeting in strasbourg ?
what happened to them ?
if there are problems in the implementation , we are ready to look at it .
i am speaking in languages that I believe are more accessible and that requires an additional effort from me .
that concludes the item .
however , there is a serious difference of opinion between the council and parliament .
europe is going through its worst economic crisis since the second world war .
we will need to resolve the complex dairy issue .
there are two things that we must impress on the commission .
we support the draft budget put forward by mr surján .
it can also be seen in the exploding unemployment figures .
we have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force .
the council and the commission have just accepted eur 280 million .
i should like to start by thanking mr surján , who has cooperated on responding to good signals .
we have also increased the allocation for the programme of research for small and medium sized businesses .
they would certainly appreciate that enormously .
the vote will take place on thursday at 11.00 .
it also needs more resources .
the israeli palestinian conflict is a striking example of this .
its conclusions are fair and balanced , and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace .
i would like to thank the european parliament for its great interest in and support for this work .
however , it is also intended that the initiative will work at a pragmatic and operational level .
the eu's support for election processes around the world is important .
how can we rid ourselves of these double standards ?
i chose this career but I have somebody who has chosen to be at home .
subject language learning in border regions
this initiative will last a number of years and is already enjoying a particular degree of success .
i want a specific answer .
if you care to check in all the other member states , you will find a similar situation .
nowadays , 19 % of young people in europe drop out of school .
you said in your response to mr aylward that volunteering brings clear economic value .
the eu urgently needs a commissioner for human rights .
however , I have three questions to ask .
i do not believe , however , that the proposed measures alone can solve the problems we are facing .
the president asked the speaker to speak more slowly 
the measures proposed here are somewhat flimsy , but they are nonetheless necessary and imperative .
the other part , which has aroused by far the most interest today , is article 18so it is not a blank cheque .
i have listened to your ideas concerning a more limited period of three or four years .
closure of the sitting
a high level of employment is required for sustainable public finances .
the council will be urged to strengthen frontex and to introduce common rules for frontex operations at sea .
it must maintain the momentum of our work to address the economic crisis , mainly its impact on unemployment .
a successful outcome at copenhagen remains a primary concern for europeans and a major task for the global community .
we need a council president who can work with us effectively .
my second point is about the external action service .
you should ensure that everything is in order before you go to copenhagen .
your speeches are very important but nevertheless , I have another request for a blue card question .
we should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content .
please , please , give us tony blair as the first president of europe .
so much the better !
i would now like to return to my own topic .
as for the new financial architecture , the commission is being quite unambitious about this .
both the czechs and the sudeten germans have experienced more than enough horror and suffering through war and displacement .
the ecological debt burdens everyone without exception .
fr mr president , my question is very simple .
i have heard that there is some speculation here , but nevertheless there is still no solution .
i am very grateful for the support and commitment that the european parliament is showing in this regard .
we of course hope that the czech republic will very soon be in a position to ratify the treaty .
hence , I have voted against the resolution .
this unfortunate pattern of behaviour persists .
this very much meets the wishes expressed in the report .
it will , as your report says , evolve over time .
in dealing with the report , I have drawn attention to certain negative attitudes coming from some areas .
at a time when all member states face huge budgetary pressures , the eu should show restraint .
national governments will be reduced to the status of a parish council .
de mr president , the council's actions are not transparent .
we want to set the political priorities of the european union for the 21st century .
