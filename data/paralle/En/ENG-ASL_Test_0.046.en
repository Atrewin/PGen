i believe that this is an open question .
this would allow europe to truly speak with one voice .
first of all , we , as the commission , are committed to making the eeas a success .
that is also what our friends in washington expect .
but let us be also clear .
vice president barrot is also ready to meet the committee on civil liberties delegation while in washington .
collaborating on innovations for the development of low carbon economies and energy efficient societies is particularly important .
it is a very small operation , as we know .
it is not the case that the us and the european union agree on every area .
commissioner ashton here will deal with this , and I will certainly convey parliament's interest .
should the eu , then , not get together to issue a special joint statement on dawit isaak ?
there are no other supplementaries on that question , so we will move on to the next question .
the council would nevertheless like to stress that the nord stream project is a private undertaking .
i do not know if the problems are greater there than anywhere else .
if it is for a supplementary on this issue , for 30 seconds you have the floor .
we must take all that into consideration before we move on to further regulation .
i am addressing the commission in order to ask it what it intends to do to end this injustice .
on the other hand , the new authorities in the republic of moldova are facing enormous difficulties .
mr president , the financial and economic situation in moldova can be summed up in a few words .
moldova is currently in the most difficult economic situation among all the states on our continent .
these are everyday matters that we will also have to solve in the future .
negotiations on an expanded , comprehensive free trade area will only start after the necessary conditions have been fulfilled .

serious efforts will need to be undertaken in the discussion of the new budgetary perspective .
i voted in favour of this report .
in addition , the treaty of lisbon will provide us with new weapons in this regard .

i hope that this is the first step towards the european union reviewing its trade policy with developing countries .
fr mr president , 150 deaths and countless instances of sexual degradation have been recorded today .
i know that many of you share my opinion .
more minors are likely to be executed shortly in iran .
international aid brings with it the obligation for the political forces in sri lanka to implement human rights .
the next item is the vote on six motions for resolutions on guinea .
that should be our contribution towards a guarantee that what we experienced can never happen again .
at the same time , I am sure that european sovereignty will gradually strengthen in the future .
indistinct or disputed boundaries are a frequent source of disaster .
but now we have to complete the task of transition .
that is obviously also true for the high representative .
we need to rekindle this flame .
what counts are the quantified commitments made by the states .
ladies and gentlemen , I began by talking about the obligation to produce results .
it is right to fight for freedom and values for all , not big jobs for the lucky few .
members here have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and rightly so .
it is a bit too late to be asking for transparency now , mr verhofstadt .
why must the president of the council be a prime minister ?
the commission has proposed aid in the region of eur 5 7 billion during the first three years .
however , allow me to make a few comments on the current debate .
therefore , unavoidably , it has a lot of ambiguities and gaps .
my fellow members cannot fail to share my opinion .
things look similar with regard to the european union minister for foreign affairs .
in fact , we need more effective tools .
i would like to mention two things that I consider to be essential .
based upon this understanding , I think we can succeed in the implementation of the lisbon treaty .
you know what I am referring to here .
from a moral standpoint , it is unacceptable to give an opt out on such an issue .
this , of course , could easily be repealed by subsequent governments .
we are only halfway now we have to get used to the new institutional framework .
it is time for women !
we will also express our disappointment over russia's recent withdrawal from the energy charter treaty .
we hope that a stronger early warning mechanism will be established and approved at the summit .
these should therefore form the basis of our work on energy security under the new eu russia agreement .
the rising nostalgia for the soviet union and stalin is also very worrying .
please take along the results of the human rights dialogue and , furthermore , do it very publicly .
it would be naive to believe that tehran would not be able to put pressure on europe .
let me now reply in more detail to your question .
the services directive is a good example .
they do need , however , freedom to do their work .
however , when production started , the government and the local authorities withdrew their consent .
a question was asked about how the contact points would function .
proper implementation is therefore the most pressing issue , especially in the current difficult economic crisis .
germany and austria wish to maintain this restriction until 2011 , without any more serious economic and social motive .
de madam president , I will be very brief .
the population's mental health is a vital issue for ensuring a decent quality of life .
the illness also involves the suffering of close relatives .
the member states need to step up their information campaigns regarding an active lifestyle .
pt last month , the regions of europe were in the spotlight .
it would affect the majority of the eu's 271 regions .
eight months have passed since this particularly important topic was discussed in a plenary session of the european parliament .
i therefore appeal to the national management authorities to get involved .
third country nationals subject to or exempt from a visa requirement when crossing external borders debate 
to my friends there , I am saying that I am committed .
it cannot do it alone .
hu I would like to welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs .
the issue of providing visa free travel is only partially a technical one .
to leave the country to collapse into insolvency ?
the european union and its member states must be able to retain existing jobs and create other new jobs .
internal dialogue did take place later on , but has , regrettably , not yet produced a final outcome .
the elections provide opportunity and hope for the amendment of these errors .
the situation in honduras is critical , not only politically , but also in social and economic terms .
any continuation would be subject to an evaluation of the impact the proposed scheme had .
i agree with my colleagues that we should adopt the 2005 approach to origin marking .
specifically , mr schlyter asked me about the expanding of the list .
it is about the level playing field .
it is about clarity and transparency for consumers .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
there were fewer instances in which the ombudsman was forced to make critical remarks to the administrative institutions involved .
unlike court rulings , an ombudsman's decisions are not legally binding .
recently , we have seen some difficulties in relation to competition files .
my last point is about communication in practice .
this was an initiative that our group took in connection with parliament's resolution on the 2006 annual report .
we know that they are nothing of the sort .
many thanks to your team .
bulgaria actively participates in this network .
we social democrats in particular have put forward a few opinions .
moreover , national parliaments also have such an instrument .
third country nationals subject to or exempt from a visa requirement when crossing external borders 
visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the western balkans , however .
around 7 million people in europe suffer from neurodegenerative diseases .
at the moment , most people have problems with this .

it appears that the european solidarity fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation .
we request that it be communicated to the european commission and the council .
in that case president sarkozy would have had no time to prevent mr putin occupying the georgian capital .
their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead polluted mitrovica .
in any event , these were inconceivably grisly killings .
i reaffirm these commitments today , adjusted of course only to the time that has elapsed since then .
this is an amendment that could not be foreseen at the beginning .
but for us here in the european parliament , this was only the beginning .
accepting restrictions on digital freedoms and going against net neutrality is not acceptable .
two concrete answers to two concrete questions first , the declaration on article 19 relating to harmonisation procedures .
that is precisely what eu citizens now expect from us .
it is obvious that the role of civil society and of parliament should be increased .
furthermore , police cooperation now comes under codecision .
i therefore think that we can cooperate as closely as possible within the framework of the new legal basis .
it is quite clear that europol is one of the european union's success stories .
this is about accountability to the citizen , because it concerns very important decisions .
certain improvements I proposed have been adopted in this area , particularly concerning europol .
i understand the commission's motives , as well as the desire to maintain consistency , very well indeed .
simplified procedure almost excludes parliament .
rapporteur . mr president , thank you firstly for your tolerance and for your presence .
applause 
this interpretation no longer stands .
emissions from international transport must be reduced .
this has also happened .
our 30 % shall also continue to be used as a leveraging tool .
the eu will continue to press for adequate measures to be tabled in the negotiations .
i am also counting wholeheartedly on the support of the members of parliament in copenhagen .
i should like to commend the efforts of the swedish presidency and the european commission , particularly commissioner dimas .
yet what we are proposing is also realistic .
it concerns the future of the entire human race .
some people are sayinggo 10 % further .
that was the right approach to take and it had my express support at the time .
that is my appeal .
industrialised countries are responsible for high co2 emissions , so they must pay for this and support developing countries .
the presidency wants to achieve success , and it wants this above all else .
my second point is that parliament has adopted a clear position for the copenhagen summit .
what can we shrewdly achieve ?
with this objective in mind , we are working on a common response .
however , this is a sector that has suffered greatly from the after effects of the crisis .
the carbon dioxide markets in fact provide a way of creating sufficient room for investment .
it is time that we reached the necessary agreement in copenhagen for the sake of the planet .
the irish people only recently displayed their commitment to the eu by voting strongly for the lisbon treaty .
the us has a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit .
the climate is changing .
it is not only the russians who think of these countries as theirnear abroad.
our group's amendments aimed at upholding citizensrights have not been adopted .
in view of this , I am voting in favour of this report requesting the commission withdraw its proposal .
it is for these reasons that I have decided to vote against this report .
we shall vote against the mfa macro financial assistance being presented today to the european parliament .
we have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken from the agenda , unfortunately without success .
how do you evaluate this standpoint from a member of the european council ?
thank you for your question , mr schulz .
mr schulz , obviously I believe that all democratic parties have a place in democratic countries .
there is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights .
that is the second thing .
i am sure you will agree with me that she is a great talent .
so it is a very broad remit of competences .
i would like to thank all those who made the approval of this budget possible .
symbols and tears are no longer enough .
one way of increasing trust is to increase our knowledge of one another's legal systems .
victims should also be offered adequate compensation for the damage or injury they have suffered .
the commission has recently presented a proposal for a joint eu resettlement programme .
this is one aspect that the majority of member states would like to see reflected in the stockholm programme .
she called the stewardess over to complain about her seating .
the exchange of information helps combat terrorism .
my second point is the one illustrated very well by my colleague mrs hennis plasschaert .
it is nothing other than the pooling of sovereignty .
let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions !
the stockholm programme should , therefore , establish a number of incentives , and should concentrate on these areas .
the eu also needs a legal basis for combating violence against women .
many people mentioned subsidiarity .
you gave the example of a british citizen in greece .
the eu's area of freedom , security and justice is entering a decisive phase .
however , creating a europe for its citizens goes far beyond simply drafting a programme .
this turns our idea of human rights on its head .
you tell us that this is not a collective expulsion .
rapporteur søren bo søndergaard
in reality , this was nothing new .
the second was that the council refused to provide any comprehensive written answers .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 200written statements rule 149 
the sitting was suspended at 19.25 until the start of question time and resumed at 19.30 
these are major investment programmes in which many hundreds of thousands of european businesses take part .
the energy consumer rights that are in the existing european legislation are already legally binding .
member of the commission . the question is about varying consumer rights and is very timely .
an overview of these national institutions and organisations is available on the website .
i think that one of these missing links is the retail market .
that is straightforward best practice .
it is absolutely clear that europe is still the most attractive destination for tourists from all over the world .
the crucial thing is actually to also generate awareness of these tourism products .
minister coughlan , please , please get organised and leverage this unique opportunity for the mid west of ireland .
that is the social side of europe , and it is a good side .
that is what the globalisation fund allows us to do .
he said that we cannot influence business decisions .
the issue of individual budget items was also raised .
the state of play of the euromed free trade area debate 
we nevertheless hope that the commission will be in a position to respond to our question .
can the commission provide further details about the practical aspects and implications of such a mechanism ?
secondly , where is the net benefit to the european union countries ?
de mr president , I think I can say my piece in even less than a minute .
i will attempt to answer your questions , where possible .
are there adequate controls ?
safety arguments are also often put forward when someone wants to stand in the way of competition .
in my view , there are huge delays on this aspect .
it does not infringe fundamental rights , however .
hungarian members here are attacking the slovak language law .
sk I would like to remain consistently on the topic of our debate .
however , the post communist chauvinist slovak government is now putting up new walls between people , linguistic barriers .
i would like to state as a regional representative that our cooperation is exemplary .
all decisions are issued in romanian as well as in the language of the minorities in that region .
the swedish presidency will put all of its energy into this work .
we are going in the opposite direction .
secondly , the council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets .
the president asked the speaker to conclude 
i would like to say a word to mr farage .
they have not been elected .
the swift programme is , indeed , a very valuable instrument for member states in their fight against terrorism .
do these personnel decisions convey an important message to us ?
cooperation between the european commission and the european parliament is hugely important here .
let me explain what I mean .
having said that , I shall now take up a number of points .
i believe that is a mistake .
finally , I would like to say one thing .
it will continue to be one of the main tasks for the european union and the new commission .
the citizens of europe expect us to deal with the problems of unemployment and the financial supervision package .
we in parliament at least have come to know mrs ashton as an excellent leader .
i am sorry that the portuguese government is not going down the route of lowering taxes .
we cannot do this by defending existing rights , but by searching for global solutions .
the solution will come from the peoples , it will come from the european parliament .
this priority on the swedish presidency's agenda has been successfully achieved .
i quote members of the european parliament shall exercise their mandate independently.
applause 
this is good and we are grateful .
we have heard three different numbers relating to the paragraph that we are just about to vote on .
we shall challenge this decision , if it is discussed again , before the court of justice .
written explanations of vote
the current situation calls for robust , proper and swift implementation of the esf .
there is no doubt that those in the countries concerned who have lost their jobs should be helped .
both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of icao negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate .
clearly , this means radical change in the production and consumption of energy .
the resolution voted on will serve as a road map for negotiation for the european union .
in this way , it would give an example to other countries , despite the difficulties involved .
it is more important to send a clear message of support for the stockholm programme from the european parliament .
it is also a resolution which guarantees the protection of refugees and migrants .
the eu must intensify efforts related to fighting transborder crime and terrorism .
the implementation of a free trade area requires the determined , ongoing and synergetic contribution of all parties .
the real solution lies in the creation of a european public air transport service .
we all know that the process has not been entirely easy .
the success of these would bring the country much closer to our european standards in areas of fundamental importance .
albania's and montenegro's applications for eu membership underscore the union's continued power of attraction .
let us keep that dream alive and , in time , make it a reality .
there is one thing about kosovo that the speaker before me has already said .
it is very disturbing to see how particular countries have so easily allowed russia to manipulate them .
as an accession candidate , turkey is already receiving eur 2.26 billion for the period from 2007 to 20this is obviously all about us interests .
enlargement requires existing members of the union to take certain measures .
mrs pack obviously did not hear me when I said that we are standing by thessaloniki .
that is not the problem .
i am of exactly the same opinion .
bullying a neighbouring country is never helpful .
it does not happen by itself .
i do not see our union asabsorbingnations .
unresolved problems are difficult to deal with after accession and remain unresolved for years .
the next item is the debate on 
it is essential that we in the eu take action now .
violence affects the victim , their families and children .
this responsibility is incumbent on all of us , the european institutions , the member states and organisations .
this means that existing mechanisms will have to be evolved and widened .
but , we all know that much more has yet to be done .
in order to resolve this situation , we obviously need an integrated approach , as commissioner ferrero waldner said earlier .
that is what we are trying to do with different training programmes .
then we have to help and protect the boats and all the people there .
they must therefore be classified as category at these times , they are therefore at risk of pirate attack .
i very much welcome the legislation that has been introduced in ireland , italy and other countries .
it is extremely positive that we are all so committed to succeeding in achieving smoke free environments .
we can no longer tackle these problems at the national or even regional levels .
surely we can manage that in the eu .
why ?
however , we need more and sustained assistance over time .
that is something we have to take very , very seriously .
until now , we worked the land to feed people .
we accept that .
thus , the scope of these rules is much more limited than the rules in force in the eu .
i am aware that some of you have expressed concern as regards our imports of beef from brazil .
we should lead by example therefore , playing by the rules governing international trade .
european stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving european union support .
before a ban in 2007 , 30 000 premises in brazil exported beef to the eu .
however , I really would like you to accept that you were forced to act .
past experience has shown us that you cannot leave it to commercial interests to resolve this problem .
but beef is a cash crop .
de madam president , our citizens have high expectations regarding the safety and quality of their food .
we applied very strict rules .
first , the court gives an unqualified opinion on the accounts for the second year running .
for the second time in a row , we can speak of an unqualified opinion on the accounts .
a third issue to be addressed is the whole system of comanagement .
our group believes in solidarity .
my colleagues from the united nations , the african union and other organisations have talked about this already .
i find it shocking that many errors are occurring in procurement with regard to projects .
where does the european commission stand on this ?
at present , most financial transfers are very indirect , passing through many intermediate stations .
this amounts to eur 2.7 billion and not eur 5 billion .
these irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds .
however , now you have the opportunity to look to the future .
we will be discussing this with the council in the next few weeks .
after all , there is strong friction here in the relationship between the european and national levels .
quite simply , I do not think this is good enough .
there are problems , however , and I wish to mention a few of them .
this is also a political issue .
nl I have been present throughout the debate .
some have said eur 4 billion , others have said eur 2 billion , and so on .
did the few errors or irregularities identified prevent projects from being completed ?
that is normal life .
you should learn about democracy , mrs gräßle .
the first of these is cooperation between the commission and the member states .
does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age ?
first , the revised settlement has been significantly narrowed in scope .
it will give students , academics and universities increased access to information and research .
we need to find an effective and practical solution to this problem .
for we must not , of course , squander this opportunity in europe .
public access to such resources is of paramount importance .
secondly , publication of out of print works requires special supervision .
before the vote 
the eu cannot continue to ignore these facts .
in other words , these are precisely the values on which the european union is founded .
europe , which has a long volunteering tradition , must help release the potential this offers .
however , I would like to raise a specific reservation over the method of assessing the agreement .
my second concern is with the proposed end of direct subsidies linked to tobacco production .
this situation is disastrous and requires effective measures , particularly on the part of the wealthy european union .
attacks and beatings of journalists multiplied .
this brings discredit upon the european parliament .
mr president , we once again have an urgent debate on vietnam and laos .
the authorities claim to have no knowledge of mr bouvanh chanmanivong .
no .
the city still retains this spirit of freedom today .
this indicates the sort of methods that china uses . these methods are unacceptable .
i fear that if we put off making a resolution , we will unduly restrict this matter .
i would like to recall some essential elements that the eu position encompasses .
we have consistently passed this message to our chinese counterparts and listened very carefully to their views .
the most important project relates to the reduction in incidences of violence .
therefore , no abstentions , but no participation either .
yes , some of you were given the floor twice , but not in one item .
it is right that , once again , this parliament shows its superior equanimity , respect and democratic maturity .
it was a written request submitted to the bureau of the european parliament .
i am continually appealing for the council to take the appropriate steps .
its objective must be to reduce the existing economic and social disparities , but in different regions of europe .
almost six months have passed , and parliament has still not found time to condemn this coup .
mr president , please write to the tunisian authorities to request the release of taoufik ben brik .
we have a partnership agreement with tunisia which contains many provisions relating to democracy and human rights .
this also goes for the population of kosovo .
unfortunately , ever since portugal joined the eu , this right to compensation has been 0 % .
farmers must not merely be producers of raw materials .
constant pressure on prices in the agricultural sector will lead to poor quality produce .
i expect the next commission to present such a proposal .
written statements rule 149 
but , of course , we can conclude the doha round only if all wto members are on board .
this is a step backwards .
for example , we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products .
we cannot behave as if we can carry on in the same way .
blame the crisis .
we have stretched to the ultimate limit of what we can do and this actually has been recognised .
by the end of november , eur 6 billion of this overall amount had been used .
as a result of this , many jobs are both lost and created every day in europe .
the economic crisis has had a drastic impact on global trade .
this support was wide ranging in many respects .
the negotiations were held in appropriate conditions .
eur 100 million is not going to turn that situation around .
i think a review of the principles of the promotional campaign is called for .
written statements rule 149 
it related to the question of mandatory certification of toys by a third body .
it is also full of examples of so called minority opinions ultimately proving to be correct .
i have listened to him heaping blame on scientists .
these substances can be avoided .
seventy percent of toys sold are below these thresholds .
what is the commission's view on the rules that should be applied here ?
we all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world .
how would we have been able to find the funds otherwise , given our tight budgetary constraints ?
of course , it was not an economic recovery package .
half a billion euros is supposed to be spent on mitigating the negative impact of globalisation .
there is no question that this budget is a burden and not a way out of the crisis .
we have just signed a treaty , but we need a new spirit .
nl mr president , we are discussing the last budget under the treaty of nice .
i should like to make a couple of brief remarks .
mr president , the 2010 budget is far from being generous just like any other budget .
the increase in spending on research and innovation is justified .
the entire funds amount to more than eur 6.6 billion .
my understanding is that there is no room for this proposal , but the situation has to be qualified .
the majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure .
to spell it out , we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective .
we also support research and development , as well as lifelong learning .
i believe that it should be our duty to increase this financial resource .
that of creating paperwork , and of financing studies and reports .
if there was ever a time to take prompt action , it is now .
currently , the financial and economic crisis is changing into a social crisis and an employment crisis .
progress is supposed to serve the development of micro enterprises and the social economy .
will you take the initiative ?
are you mr 2020 ?
mr president , my question concerns the situation in greece .
we want to help them to be closer to us .
if I were the person involved , I would take the matter to the courts .
colleagues , the blue card procedure is not applicable now because these are discussions between two people .
fr mr barroso , all the same , the question was clear .
thank you , mrs ries .
we should treat our social partners a little more seriously .
regarding the issue of the mechanisms of governance , that is exactly what we are now preparing .
this was our third question hour with the president of the european commission .
i am very sorry about that we would have preferred to have had a lot of you here .
mr barroso , you are on a good enough salary , sir .
last week , the foreign affairs council discussed the situation in the middle east and adopted conclusions .
we have therefore made clear our support for the efforts by the united states to achieve peace .
we now need to think about how we can re engage a political process .
our approach should be regional and inclusive .
this was a gesture to help bring about peace talks .
this rhetorical question was put by the united states at the start of december .
in any case , mr president , the council's conclusions do not exactly incite optimism .
well , we have the policy .
i would now like to quote three of the recommendations from the report .
may I say one more thing .
as cecilia malmström has said today , the status of jerusalem should be negotiated bilaterally by israelis and palestinians .
you cannot boycott and engage at the same time .
unfortunately , the current system is characterised by abuses of fundamental rights .
once a person's name is on the list , it is very difficult to have it removed .
something must be done otherwise , I cannot follow the debate .
the measures taken as part of the fight against terrorism must be proportionate , appropriate and effective .
they are perhaps a little difficult for anyone listening to this debate to understand .
we must pursue those people to the ends of the earth and restrict them as much as possible .
all of us , without exception , agree that we need to act decisively against terrorism .
the vote shall take place tomorrow .
that is what I believe is at the heart of the treaty of lisbon .
you are indeed the face of the fight for this particular regulation and for openness and transparency in parliament .
that is not always easy .
we do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new parliament .
i know that this is the time of year when you write wish lists .
it is important that not only parliament have full access to these documents .
during the lisbon treaty process , for better or for worse , they asked the citizens to trust them .
if anyone is afraid of that , there is absolutely no need to be .
let me take this opportunity to thank you once more for all your cooperation over all those years .
we will raise these issues in our talks with russia .
the georgian language is banned in many places .
mr president , we are discussing the aspirations of ukraine , moldova and georgia .
we will also provide further financial assistance for the aftermath of the conflict .
this , unfortunately , is sometimes quite difficult .
we cannot just ask them to come into the european union if the council is not unanimous on it .
the reason is that it has become much more vulnerable than the western part of europe .
hu mr president , influenza strikes down those who have a weak constitution .
we agree in many respects .
however , our delight is mixed with a degree of disappointment .
the euro is an important incentive for investments and economic growth , reducing vulnerability .
however , this suggestion is still pending , as you know .
madam president , I echo the remarks made by my colleague , mr almunia .
we have a duty to support , acknowledge and assist them .
the commission has a dual role in this area .
a budget of eur 2 200 000 was allocated to this initiative for 2008 alone .
it intends to support measures aimed at encouraging victims of terrorism to share their experiences .
i dedicate this speech to all the victims of terrorism .
it is an imperative in order to send terrorists a clear message that we do not forget .
de madam president , I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate .
therefore , we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the court .
we are discussing the principle of subsidiarity .
i am actually from an electoral constituency where 99 % of the electorate are catholic .
this religious and cultural diversity is what makes us , is what makes europe .
having said that , the commission may not act outside the legal framework laid down by the treaties .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 december 200written statements rule 149 
a crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe , or not to believe .
nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols .
i would like to tell you that it is far too early to be doing this .
the leaderstask will be to move this forward to a deal .
we know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at copenhagen .
there has been no tough line on turkey , which continues to occupy cyprus illegally .
no , it is not enough .
yet our global trading position , relative economic weight and international competitiveness are in jeopardy .
the eu strategy for the baltic sea region was endorsed during the swedish presidency .
the swedish presidency's role was to pave the way for the implementation of the lisbon treaty's provisions .
today , in relation to the global character of the financial crisis , such options are not available .
unfortunately , amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left were rejected .
the wto could manage globalisation better .
i therefore voted in favour .
that means they also died for europe , since a europe without russia is incomplete .
freedom of thought is the basis of all other freedoms .
that is behind us .
we hope that a new government will soon be in place .
we hope that the conference to be held in london shortly will create some momentum .
there can be no lasting military withdrawal from afghanistan unless a civil framework for stability is in place .
we are making a long term commitment to afghanistan .
those who have taken part in conflict in the past must be offered alternatives .
finally on afghanistan , but perhaps most importantly , we are streamlining our structures on the ground .
when looked at more closely , it is actually a mixture of naivety and complicity in their methods .
in my view , it does not .
we must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the afghan reformists .
this is a major , everyday problem that we must bear in mind .
this support is conditional on transparency and clarity .
i think , however , that we should continually ask about the effectiveness of our assistance .
i would have liked more to have been said about this .
this is going to take time .
we have to be realistic .
the situations in both countries are closely linked and success in one depends on the other .
it is imperative we take action to improve the situation in afghanistan .
we launched a dialogue on human rights issues in june 200the commission is engaged in a growing number of technical dialogues with belarus on issues of mutual interest .
but naturally , the final decision on the negotiation directives will lie with the council .
thirdly , dialogue could be assisted through a relaxation of the eu's visa policy .
meanwhile 28 % of residents would like better relations with russia .
it will be a christmas present for us .
what conclusions should the european institutions draw from this ?
the second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance .
however , congo does not have to be a heart of darkness .
the money from this is used to procure weapons and encourage crime in this country .
lastly , there is a lot of criticism also of international criminal justice .
the atmosphere within the coordination body for southern serbia has since improved .
subject unemployment levels
thank you for your question , mrs harkin .
at the same council meeting , ministers agreed that employment is an important factor for the avoidance of exclusion .
referring to your question , sir , I am not really sure that I understood it .
president in office of the council . vessels have been the subject of questions during question time on numerous occasions .
the eu will therefore ask them to increase their efforts further in the context of an ambitious agreement .
hu thank you very much , minister , for your answer .
all this when disabled people actually account for around 10 % of our residents in the european union .
our directive would be binding for all eu member states , so that disabled people would not face discrimination .
thank you for your question .
subject iceland's application to join the european union
the sitting was opened at 09.00 
i am surprised that these guidelines are only appearing after more than four years .
mr president , let us get straight to the point here .
our approach is to create stronger networks .
life long learning is an important concept .
it must bring about sustainable development in the regions .
we will support proposals of this kind , but we will fight every attempt to destroy regional policy .
i am very concerned that the commission will fail us in this respect .
therefore , I would like to ask the commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 20it would also , of course , have huge economic , financial and social consequences for those regions .
lastly , global warming does not seem to me to come under cohesion policy .
it has caused numerous inequalities and pressures , especially among vulnerable groups .
these debates will lead to the preparation of a fully fledged commission position in autumn 20finally , I would like to thank all honourable members for their questions and suggestions .
i would ask my fellow members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process .
we will take your suggestion into account .
having said that , we are not questioning in any way whatsoever what has been agreed .
next time , there will not be such complications , because the treaty of lisbon will be in force .
mr brok , will you please leave the chamber and have your discussion outside .
we need seriously to end this now .
i shall abstain for the same reasons .
without it , this news would unfortunately be nothing other than a publicity stunt .
only yesterday , parliament was voting for aid to be granted under the european globalisation adjustment fund .
in writing . I welcome the outcome of this vote on the 2010 budget .
transparency is important and its importance is growing in the age of globalisation .
it is our common philosophical heritage and safeguards the principle of civil peace around which the eu was built .
i hope the resolution on belarus is one of many steps we will take .
applause 
es mr president , I would like to emphasise what mr meyer has said .
we have two further important points .
es mr president , this is indeed a point of order .
luckily nothing happened , but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in uganda .
this principle is not open to debate .
however , due to the reasons we already know , I cannot .
uganda has ratified these conventions .
however , currently , these are all under serious threat with the present regime .
freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy .
for over five years , I have been a member of the eu southern caucasus parliamentary cooperation committees .
azerbaijan will also benefit from assistance under the european initiative for democracy and human rights .
this will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our messages .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the next item is voting time .
texts of agreements forwarded by the council see minutes
after detroit , to give you an example , the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution .
can we , with a clear conscience , deport people who have been the victims of racial persecution ?
i would like to thank france and portugal for their cooperation in the fight against eta .
fr mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the gaza strip is being threatened with strangulation .
however , since the alde group has probably not had enough speeches , the last speaker is mr gallagher .
this is what we believe we are delivering .
that will also be addressed within the framework of the eu institutions .
these are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for haitians .
in all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos , clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed .
applause 
within a matter of days , the united states has assumed a dominant role in rescue and coordination matters .
in addition , we should think about what could be done better .
as for the others , they will join us when they realise that this is the future .
why ?
twenty one member states were mobilised to respond .
he advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force .
we work through the united nations the general assembly adopted a resolution condemning the situation only last month .
we must , however , keep the communication channels to the outside world open .
the eu should redouble its efforts to expedite that process in every way possible .
they risk life imprisonment or worse , simply because their religion is different from that of the ruling power .
on the contrary , iran's long history shows us this .
i would urge you to continue with the dialogue .
an inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive .
we would pay the price ourselves .
indeed , citizens have the right to demand faultless monitoring of the terrorist threat .
maybe you can also help to get them freed .
madam president , we debated earlier the deteriorating human rights situation and brutal fascist regime in iran .
the vote will take place during the first part session in february .
these interests are increasingly being defended by military means , and with ever greater aggressiveness .
we are also developing our relations with iraq .
there are , indeed , positive signs .
i would appreciate a response from you .
baroness ashton , I am sorry but I do not share your optimism .
i think the eu should , in particular , help with the rebuilding of babylon .
that point was well made .
how long ?
how can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority ?
in this emerging setting , a reduction in plenary jpa meetings would make sense .
i am greatly pleased by the commissioner's declaration that the european commission has no such intentions .
there are myriad mechanisms that currently ensure that many of these countries remain subject to domination and subjugation .
there were some questions on fiscal matters .
that was with regard to the council during the swedish presidency .
this is a fundamental step in the creation of european legislation on minimum procedural rights .
they pour shame on the inaction of governments in council .
the authors of this oral question are right they require europe's urgent attention .
though I am ashamed , I have to agree with them because I myself have had similar experiences .
the common procedures are about lowering european legal standards and not raising them .
the commission will endeavour to have all the measures planned in the roadmap adopted as soon as possible .
we absolutely agree that this is the right approach .
their rights and their future must be top priority .
in addition , there are two other matters .
we really owe it to all the victims .
the victims of human trafficking are the most vulnerable and defenceless people , and they need our protection .
they must be offered residence permits .
very often , we do not want to see it .
the victims do not receive appropriate assistance , shelter or compensation .
as you said , minister , political will does exist in the european parliament .
written statements rule 149 
it is very important to make a distinction between the two .
however , I am confident in the capacities of europe .
thank you , mr barroso .
the lisbon strategy failed due to the reluctance of the member states to keep their own promises .
it must be a good omen , though !
it is either one thing or the other .
there was scarcely room for mr obama even .
such common ground can be found , in my view , in the emissions trading mechanism .
they are damaging !
mr schulz , thank you for your words .
also , it works .
now , I believe that the answer lies in the treaty of lisbon .
the measure of a good presidency is not conventional speeches or great words , or common places .
that is illustrative of the importance which it ascribes to consumer protection .
help him to secure the stability and growth pact .
mr zapatero , with regard to the social pact in particular , you have our full support .
finally , in contrast to your fellow european members represented here , spain still refuses to recognise kosovo .
these really are challenges which again require more common resources and better political coherence .
that is a good thing .
i would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned .
what the citizens of the european union really need is jobs .
you made many wonderful comments about european citizenship and fairness and honesty .
mr president , one of the changes the prime minister spoke of this morning is the citizensinitiative .
specifically , there are no concrete measure to combat unemployment .
welcome
one example is the canary islands and the people who live there .
i wish to ask you , what are european interests ?
this will not occur in any other area or region of the world .
applause 
however , it lacked a clear reference to the problem of huge deficits .
however , will the newly appointed high representative for foreign affairs and security policy do this ?
firstly , because one of the priorities of the spanish presidency is energy security .
i understand and support this .
this is what will be produced on 25 january .
no response to the conditions laid down by parliament has been received .
only one mep was present in brussels . that mep happened to be me .
it is as simple as that .
this is no small task we are facing .
i wonder if mr bloom would like to tell the house the difference between climate and weather .
the world today is determined by economic fundamentalism .
the us and china together account for almost half .
however , china and the us are opting for a different route .
firstly , we should take the lead as regards committing ourselves to reduction targets .
we cannothalf committo investment in renewable energy sources and low carbon transport .
europe should , therefore , reconsider the organisational aspects of such conferences .
after copenhagen , we cannot behave and we cannot do politics the same way as we did before copenhagen .
es I would like to welcome mrs espinosa I am very pleased that she is here .
i share your hope that , in mexico our second chance we shall do better .
in this way , we would achieve equal contributions from each member state , without unnecessary complications .
the eu has the interest and capability to push this kind of change through in the un system .
let us continue to put our own house in order .
i can only say that it is time the eu woke up to reality .
question time council 
subject eu integration of kosovo
i think you are off to a very good start this week .
this is particularly the case in 2010 , which is the year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
in the treaties of the european union , there is a clear division of competences .
in modern europe , quite simply , they are not .
eighteen months ago , the governing justice and development party akp narrowly escaped the same fate .
the progress reports on turkey presented to the european parliament are the result of the balances between these forces .
elected representatives are being persecuted and jailed en masse .
today's debate has focused largely on the party closure and rightly so .
pacta sunt servanda that is always emphasised in connection with turkey , and rightly so .
it is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities , towns , districts and the citizens in this .
member states are stakeholders in this and will submit proposals on this by the end of the month .
what we already agree upon rather are principles and things that go without saying .
the danube strategy is evidence that the danube is indeed a supra national river .
these are questions to which we must find an answer as quickly as possible .
so , in conclusion , I would like to thank you for your support for the danube strategy .
let us work together .
why is the tunisian government taking so long to respond to the un report ?
but look at what tunisia did .
mrs kroes said that we are talking about integrating the tunisian economy into the single market .
three men have been taken into custody , but , generally speaking , the violence against christians is tolerated .
this is an outrageous disgrace !
the place of anti christian communism has today been taken principally by militant islam .
it is this respect that is missing in the resolution .
the relationship that the european union is able to maintain with china is of particular importance .
the fact is , the human rights situation in china is unacceptable .
however , that fact should not stop us from raising these issues in parliament .
at the same time , google is visibly calling for freedom of speech for chinese internet users .
there has been criticism regarding their policy in china over the years , questioning the motto .
apparently , google will be less evil in the future .
we expect the same today .
since that day , neither his family nor his loved ones have had any news of him .
oral explanations of vote
i am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution presented here .
the idea of establishing functional regions macro regions began with the baltic sea region strategy .
written declarations included in the register rule 123 see minutes
mr president , we believe that the item on madagascar is not particularly important today .
in accordance with your proposal , I will analyse the problem thoroughly and make a statement on this .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
it is , indeed , a tragic case .
how is the eu protecting the most vulnerable groups ?
the new directive represents a qualitative and quantitative leap forward in this respect .
the interest of europe as a whole must take precedence over partial viewpoints .
thank you .
we may criticise the tax burden in our own countries .
thank you and good luck .
we have to work together to fight tax fraud and dubious tax havens .
this directive is an essential statement of our intention to do that .
tax fraud and evasion result in poorer gdp results to the tune of around eur 200 billion a year .
i call on colleagues to bear this in mind when making proposals on this matter .
the detection of fiscal and social fraud is complex even in the internal market .
gm / opel current developments debate 
there is just one item on the agenda the enhancement of european economic cooperation .
the chemical industry has to contend with european climate policy .
radical change is now required .
i should like to conclude by addressing a few words to the representatives of the belgian parties in office .
or are these not concepts that can be used in the context of the economy ?
this has met with a dubious reception from public opinion .
the commission shares the rapporteur's view that it is essential to continue with our efforts .
the commission has noted the interesting ideas contained in the european parliament's resolution .
the majority of the almost 80 million people living in poverty in europe are women and children .
at the same time , consideration must always be given to maintaining the balance between career and family obligations .
i welcome this report and applaud the emphasis that mr tarabella puts on the economic well being of women .
it is the economy that is coming up with all the solutions .
we need to create the conditions for that to become a reality .
domestic violence is a horrible reality many women are indeed murdered in their own homes .
women must not be in the role of supplicants .
one final example companies whose management consists of at least 30 % women achieve better business success .
the fact is , the european machine is obviously still in need of some adjustments .
that is also an enormous step forward in the cooperation between our two institutions .
calm down , my friend , calm down !
what initiative did the commission come up with to address the crisis in greece ?
applause 
they provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in europe .
if you go on pushing your extreme euro nationalism , this will lead to violence .
ladies and gentlemen , honourable members of parliament , we all have work to do in this regard .
the close collaboration of these institutions is necessary in order to achieve results .
we do not think that the treaty of lisbon is the most important thing .
the responsibilities have been divided up .
i do not yet know how I will vote later .
the commission has to take into account the differences , opportunities and means of each member state .
the citizens have expectations you spoke of being bold with regard to the european agenda .
the candidatesanswers were often agreed in advance , and were couched in indecently general terms .
my best wishes , president barroso !
it furthermore rules out the sui generis construct .
you have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner .
i am looking at your vice president , lady ashton .
it is important not to reduce the significance of the presidency held by individual member states .
is it going to be one of the commissioners ?
since its creation with 11 participants , the euro area has grown to comprise 16 member states .
the euro area has been an area of stability and job creation .
in fact , many of you have urged the commission to keep a strong accent on collegiality .
it is very important to relaunch the internal market now .
without an internal market , we will not have a strong european union .
applause 
the ppe group expects the commission to work effectively on all these fronts , at the same time .
in mr barroso , we have the right leader to take the commission forward .
then they gave 27 people total unlimited power .
instead , we need more democracy .
explanations of vote
the president cut off the speaker 
fr mr president , baroness ashton and her federalist friends treat us as anti europeans .
written explanations of vote
furthermore , our ideologies are completely different .
he also promised to come back with a regulation for resolving the problems as soon as possible .
the outcome of the negotiations between the commission and parliament is also satisfactory .
it is currently merely a european parliament wish list , with no obligation .
however , the interinstitutional agreement does contain some important steps in the right direction .
i shall therefore vote against a commission that is the antithesis of this .
economic recovery will largely come as a result of changing our energy model .
the future of the economy is the future of the green economy .
while some of the nominated commissioners are competent , others are not .
they should be given the opportunity , as they wish , to familiarise themselves with europe's challenges .
plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage .
the measures and policy intentions outlined in this programme are an important step in the right direction .
each report will be subject to a commission assessment .
admittedly it is months too late , but it is absolutely necessary .
i wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on .
however , they should not form this basis alone .
to make up this deficit , washington has to borrow each day more than usd 5 billion .
instead , they take the opportunity to seize greater control while you are on your knees .
the union shall take measures to ensure coordination of the employment policies . 
this was not just a statistical correction .
the existence of this detention centre is a serious problem , of course , for transatlantic relations .
europe must do more as well .
there are numerous reports of the murder and of the most dreadful abuse and humiliation of the detainees .
in essence , however , we first need to clarify three points .
key objectives for the conference of the parties to the cites debate 
i now come to the controversial issue .
that is behind parliament's resolution concerning polar bears , elephants , tigers , big asian cats and sharks .
this is crucial for the survival of this species .
that is certainly not a sensible way to proceed .
i therefore propose that this identity marking be taken to doha as a useful contribution to the debate .
it is no different than asking to close down the whole salmon industry in scotland in one swipe .
i firmly believe , however , that mere physical investment in infrastructure will not solve the problems of ghettos .
this is an eminently european issue .
the new text stipulates a rate of 4 % .
i therefore welcome the fact that the eu is looking for ways to help these people .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
the agreement was signed on 4 november in stockholm and ratified by the croatian parliament on 20 november .
this is what the european union believes and will continue to believe .
it achieved visa liberalisation , and the commission could recommend starting accession negotiations .
applause 
well done for this initiative !
on cyprus , I attempted to reach a clear and broad based compromise with the shadow rapporteurs .
i think there was good cooperation in the process and I thank my colleagues .
i count on your support .
this momentum is diminishing day by day .
we do not feel that turkey's membership is either realistic or opportune for many reasons .
let us take the example of the armed forces .
this is a good thing .
see the last report of the un high commissioner for refugees .
that is the path turkey is taking at the moment .
de madam president , firstly , congratulations to mr füle on his appointment as commissioner .
turkey has indeed made good progress , but many points of concern must be addressed urgently .
accession to the union is the only option to stabilise the region .
turkey needs to honour all its contractual obligations , as all previous candidate countries have done .
however , we cannot have à la carte accession tailored to turkey .
madam president , I welcome commissioner füle and I would like to congratulate the authors for three well balanced reports .
there is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain .
let us be fair , let us be correct and let us be credible .
can I ask mrs flautre a question ?
in any case , madam president , the presidency's position on negotiations with turkey is absolutely clear .
some members have the habit of not reading out the number for roll call votes .
de mr president , this has been discussed with the groups .
i shall be brief .
2009 progress report on croatia 
to these sums can also be added the more than eur 92 million already pledged by individual member states .
mr president , friday will mark one month since the devastating earthquake in haiti .
in any case , we must be clear and defend european values even in our relations with the iranians .
europe must take more decisive action to restrict this shameful procedure .
our group does not disagree with the observation that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
and yet , this principle has not been enshrined in the arbitration agreement .
meanwhile , subject a does not pay vat , as he is not the end seller .
on the other hand , as after the asian tsunami , we need to draw lessons from what happened .
mr president , I endorsed adoption of the resolution on human trafficking .
reduction targets must be measurable , significant and verifiable for everyone if there is to be climate justice .
in writing . using ccctb to combat double taxation is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
such statements must , however , be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements .
in addition , the religious and moral aspects are an important element .
these must have supporting data and substantiated scientific opinions .
after a period of deadlock lasting more than nine months , accession negotiations resumed in october 200the report also notes a number of issues affecting the process of croatia's integration into the european union .
i voted in favour of it , because croatia should become a member state in the near future .
yet turkey is a friendly nation , with a very rich history and culture .
turkey must understand that it cannot change its past .
at the same time , we realise how important the swift agreement is for completely different reasons .
these are just some of the examples judge bruguière cites in his report .
secondly , we strongly support security for our citizens and also citizensrights and data protection .
under the terms of the homeland security act , data can be stored for up to 90 years .
it is a pleasure to see you here .
the member states are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the eu .
this balance must be reflected in the agreement that we are currently debating .
show us how effective these measures are using open documents , not secret ones .
ro the council sent the agreement to the european parliament very late , which is extraordinary .
i hope that there will be no more recurrences of incidents of this nature .
therefore , we are debating an interim agreement today which improves the current situation .
the netherlands and belgium cannot end up being thedupeof all this .
terrorism has to be well organised to survive , and for this it principally needs money .
there are five conclusions .
i will do so this year .
this is another thought for the future .
what is more , the scanners are also user friendly .
mr president , back to body scanners .
the first is cosi , the standing committee on internal security .
those of us who value peace , freedom and democracy ought to be concerned about terrorism because it works .
ladies and gentlemen , we now come to catch the eye .
how will protection of the images of people who are scanned be guaranteed ?
civil liberty groups have the duty to weigh all new measures being advocated .
for it is difficult to suppose that terrorists will agree to being scanned .
most importantly , it demonstrates ukraine's attachment to european values .
elections have winners and losers .
it is logical and legitimate that any possible problems are investigated .
it still has its multi party system , and this is mainly thanks to the orange revolution .
we cannot simply let things go on as they have before .
this will remain the eu's responsibility .
question time council 
the council has investigated these cases and has brought them to the attention of the chinese authorities .
what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy ?
however , no trade war came about .
that would amount to considered action and leadership on our part .
this is the other side of the coin .
this crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets .
for the acp countries , for example , trade in goods represents 50 % of their trade .
we must fight against any protectionist tendencies .
therefore , I call on the commission to develop a new strategy for world trade .
the commission has assured us that korea is actively liberalising its import regime .
the fta is currently being translated .
the economic benefits of the fta are mostly in the eu's favour .
to protect our industry against import increases causing or threatening injury , the fta contains an effective safeguard mechanism .
mr caspary also made this point .
we have heard them here tonight about the car industry .
these complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered .
we have had three commissioners on international trade , two eu council presidents and the lisbon treaty .
this is the first major fta .
we did not think that events would prove us right so quickly .
they keep signalling to me to tell me that they cannot keep up with you .
mr de gucht , perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms .
i would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when .
the risks of infection following an accident are not insignificant .
i congratulate commissioner andor .
sometimes we say that europe needs to get closer to its citizens .
that is why prevention , healthcare and job security are essential .
thank you , commissioner .
that cannot be right .
commissioner , that is the context of this question .
you simply have to face this fact .
we are striving to ensure that communications between people are as open as possible .
there is no responsible or immediate management present to ensure that the gambler is of age and acting legally .
there are two internationally recognised scales which can measure problem gambling .
i confirm that the commission does not rule out solutions other than infringement procedures .
thank you very much , commissioner , for that full and encouraging reply .
the commission will then immediately launch negotiations with the us to try to conclude them as soon as possible .
my goal is to achieve a new agreement with very ambitious safeguards for privacy and data protection .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on venezuela .
i wish that they were only administrative problems and the rights of these media bodies would be restored .
the pegging of the national currency to the us dollar was probably another counterproductive move .
as europeans , we must have the courage to speak out against such practices .
unfortunately , certain people do not believe in this yet .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
as a result , the country's cable providers stopped broadcasting seven channels .
the debate is closed .
the reduction in funds which are destined for this area and for these refugees is of great concern .
not long ago I myself spoke about it .
hu the military junta has promised free , democratic elections for 20this may put an end to the recurring ethnic conflicts .
the eu has several times issued declarations condemning violations of human rights .
that concludes voting time .
there is no doubt that we are in favour of debate .
i was glad to find such a level of ambition around the table .
our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future .
however , because it is still divided , europe is unable to punch its full weight .
can we tolerate this any more ?
is that what you are advocating ?
there is the excessive public sector , for example .
as an integrated strategy , it is , in principle , not bad , but .
even before the recent crisis , the economies of europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors .
the internal market needs to be reinvigorated and extended to new fields .
mr president , in times of need , you discover who your friends are , as the saying goes .
the same work in the same place must receive the same wage .
mr farage , I am sorry but it was not a personal statement .
an eu 2020 strategy focused on innovation in areas of existing expertise .
fr presidents , after the lisbon strategy , we now have the 2020 strategy .
we should be looking at 40 % by 20of course , the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency .
you are a man of great quality .
i would like to ask him to reconsider his approach to the issue of parliamentary questions .
i will explain .
we did not do what was done in the 1930s , namely restore budgetary equilibrium as quickly as possible .
however , we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s .
in fact , every crisis is a challenge .
iran has signalled that it might run in the elections for a place on the council .
clearly , therefore , this body has little substantive moral authority .
however , it should take a critical look at itself .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the implementation of goldstone recommendations on israel / palestine .
a population was thrown into panic , trapped and unable to escape .
the destruction remains and the siege continues .
this policy is harmful to the people of israel and therefore to peace in the middle east .
unfortunately , mr goldstone has not seen fit to investigate whether this actually was the case .
it is that simple it just needs to be applied .
while it makes far reaching demands of israel , it says little about hamas .
how is this possible ?
minority rights as part of human rights cannot be considered an internal matter .
let us await its report , and only then will we decide on further action .
she then transformed the building into a vibrant cultural and social centre for the polish minority .
i entirely agree with the ppe group that paragraph 9 is central .
we will do it together .
gender equality policy cannot and must not be a subject for voting on and for narrow , enforced majorities .
their needs are largely unknown and ignored and their voices are not heard .
access to these rights is a particular problem , since legal redress is often extremely expensive and complicated .
it should therefore be justified to ask why we are always talking about it .
i make a call to all the men in this parliament .
it is my belief that the european union will welcome this major agreement .
ro last week , I attended the meeting of the european union moldova parliamentary cooperation committee .
this is a clear case of unfair competition .
it is opening the window to the acquisition of european nationality to an indeterminate number of illegal immigrants .
we therefore used this criterion to distribute the speeches equally .
financial resources and the required swiftness of operation are necessary for this purpose .
the planet is sending us an sos message .
this data needs to be aggregated at national and regional level .
in my opinion , there are two layers to this proposal .
the significance of energy security is repeated in a variety of documents , debates and meetings .
this regulation will provide the european commission with information about energy structures so that it can obtain an overview .
this includes data about oil and natural gas infrastructures , as well as for renewable energy sources .
various gas pipelines , off shore wind parks and power stations by the dozen are at the drawing board stage .
if europe is to confront these problems , it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal .
this is going to be a difficult decision for members tomorrow .
it is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resources .
this budgetary amendment provides a response to a real need .
as you all know , the last reform in 2002 was not sufficiently successful .
i will try , if at all possible , to make sure that meetings do not clash in future .
but the problem is how waters are being fished , not by whom .
indiscriminate trawling and longline fishing empty our seas of marine life .
i am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy .
all the important things have already been said .
it must accentuate the social dimension , give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy .
the management policy based on tacs and quotas must leave room for effort based management .
tourism also plays an important role in this respect .
these are our priorities .
the system is known as ertms european rail traffic management system .
after disasters of this kind , people's first response is often to find someone to blame .
who has suffered because of them ?
this was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal .
transport ten t networks again we will discuss it soon .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
mr president , this is only a factual correction .
we have seen since the 1970s where that process leads .
lt I greatly welcome the decision adopted on new rules in the fishing sector .
despite the current economic crisis , neoliberal dogmas continue to underpin many eu policies .
no minority must be overlooked .
the high electoral turnout is particularly worthy of note .
for the consequences of bilateral relations between ukraine and russia also concern eu member states .
its agenda includes the economic and financial crisis and the united nations declaration on human rights education and training .
this justifies an increase in staff for parliament's and the groupssecretariats in these committees .
measures to replace / improve vessels have only benefited large companies .
fishing communities are currently undergoing a difficult period , marked by severe deterioration in fish stocks .
wednesday , 10 march marks the 51st anniversary of the popular uprising in tibet .
where is this procedure now ?
nowadays , it is not only a matter of giving flowers to women we know .
mr president , as you have said , today is international women's day .
we can provide educational opportunities and employment , but the pay gap still remains .
is this not violence ?
i am delighted to see that commissioner rehn is moving in that direction .
essentially , mr chávez is cooperating with eta criminals .
for example , in colombia , assassinations of trade unionists continue to happen practically on a daily basis .
i believe it is important that the commission and the presidency proceed with more caution .
this saw ethnic cleansing carried out also in the name of bandera .
the rights must be tailored to eu standards and the ilo conventions .
likewise , nobody forced us to hesitate and falter when the so calledperipheraleconomies come under attack .
i am very pleased that we have this agreement .
they wanted to take them to ferret exhibitions across europe .
it will be necessary to take measures in this area .
we need transparent systems .
it also sets out consumersrights and the responsibilities of distributors and tourism service providers .
we need clarification , we need certainty , and we need protection for the consumer .
such a situation is not good either for consumers or for business .
however , there are also other ways that taxation could be raised within financial services .
are these truly complementary ?
it is a shame though that our government has not been able to do that .
it will not even hinder what are sometimes called speculative investments .
nonetheless , in my opinion , any such measure should not simply be considered a temporary measure .
these countries are now being forced to borrow from the same banks , thereby paying them twice .
we must be clear .
i would say yes , but what for ?
no longer is the proposal being advocated just by academics and minority or opposition groups .
an expiry date would indeed have several positive effects .
that is another reason why I am calling for the proposal on micro entities to be adopted quickly .
what is the outcome of this situation ?
we were promised these proposals for 20only seven per cent of the micro entities that we are talking about are involved in cross border activities .
micro entities , moreover , cannot afford this effort at all .
this global review I have told you , early 2011 will take time .
my sixth comment relates to the position of business associations .
parliament has reminded us of its wish to see competition policy operating within the framework of the codecision procedure .
mr president , the rapporteur referred to cartels .
in 2008 , that was not a problem .
by mr buşoi , on behalf of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , on solvit .
the transposition deficit has fallen to 0.7 % , so significantly lower than the target set .
providing solvit with additional staff obviously incurs some costs as well .
we are talking about the internal market .
one element of this strategy relates to the handling of collective claims .
it gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning .
we need more instruments that make it clear that citizens are protected in the internal market .
moreover , parents also have control over their children's consumption , especially when they are young .
that must be dealt with .
that needs to be looked at so that there is proper staffing .
the report contains some of these solutions , while others have been raised for discussion in this debate .
zocor 20 mg
schengen stands for freedom of movement .
it is essential for this to occur in order to avoid an omission in the law .
a lot of concerns were voiced .
responses to this disaster also need to be more than mere palliatives .
further development of the confidential database on consumer problems is essential for the identification of markets .
the scoreboards clearly show which markets are not sufficiently meeting the needs of consumers .
in addition , I hope they will supply us with yet more detailed information than before .
the report we adopted today clearly describes the benefits of this instrument .
your examples are misleading .
it is therefore imperative that member states transpose internal market legislation into national law in a timely manner .
despite their obligations , member states are delaying transposition and are also carrying out transposition incorrectly .
mr almunia was the competent commissioner .
this issue of the greek accounts was addressed several times in euro area meetings .
that in itself is an enormous change from recent years .
we have seen your protest .
it is not justified to buy insurance and buy unseen interventions on a risk on a purely speculative basis .
everything takes place behind closed doors here everything is swept under the carpet .
this relates to what the first speaker was saying about eritrea .
it was negotiated and we have an intergovernmental treaty that recognises this .
president barroso , are you prepared to give an answer ?
every project that does not take this into account is doomed to failure .
that is new , I think .
where will our growth come from in the future ?
i have two questions , commissioner one is on the quick start money .
it needs a lot of concrete work .
modern flats have been built and given to them , the same which other people have to buy .
the most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties .
finally , this is not simply a budgetary issue and it does not depend merely on resources .
this is why I support the strategy of the union .
what we must avoid doing is creating a strategy which exists only on paper .
hu mr president , we have a technical problem .
thank you .
the objective now is to reduce poverty by a quarter by 20these elements are all present in the eu 2020 strategy .
of these , 34 % of people living in poverty are unemployed and 14 % are working poor .
subject evaluation of the culture programme 2007 2013
the commission is currently working on the european road safety strategy for the next decade .
the commission , of course , will closely follow their proper implementation by the member states .
pl mr kallas , I think we should draw conclusions from this tragedy .
it can become more complicated .
that concludes question time .
yet here he is , hiding in the eu , away from his faithful supporters .
he is calling for privatisation .
he is , in fact , thefat controller, creating fat pay packets for fat cats .
i believe that this review is long overdue .
lay the negotiation documents on the table straight away .
will there be criminal sanctions ?
i strongly disagree with their approach but I cannot unilaterally breach a confidentiality commitment .
however , we know that this is where the heart of european union competitiveness resides .
let us work together to find this balance between rights and responsibilities .
i want to have all the documents on the table now , and for all citizens .
europe has always been the continent where people's freedom to accumulate knowledge takes pride of place .
this freedom would now be under serious threat , which cannot and must not happen .
are they there to safeguard their commercial interests ?
this is where the importance of the pvv becomes clear .
what have you done since then ?
now that we have the treaty of lisbon in place , that is no longer possible .
so it is a little bit difficult then to question me as to what this is all about .
last but not least , I disagree with what has been said by some colleagues on colombia .
opening of the sitting
it is a time to be smart and ambitious .
economic weight is translating into political clout and self confidence .
and yes , there is a tendency in europe to put process ahead of outcomes .
we should not lower our ambitions but , rather , give ourselves the means to realise them .
in a way , the balkans is the birthplace of eu foreign policy .
it is a serious issue that needs a serious debate .
the dual track approach and the preparation of smart targeted sanctions by the un security council are warranted .
this week , we celebrated 8 march .
we do not agree with having united states military bases in the european union .
it is not about operating above the heads of member states .
it would be wrong to take excessively quick and thus wrong decisions .
today marks 100 days since the treaty of lisbon entered into force .
catherine ashton gives us a graphic description of the eu as a rising power from a declining continent .
de the new report , like the albertini report , supports a union training mission in somalia .
for me , that is excessive we are biting off more than we can chew here .
you agree with us that peace building is important , but will you anchor it in the external action service ?
a trend that can also be observed in candidate countries like turkey .
but we in ukip were on to this from the start .
that would get you to the moon , and most people now would like you to stay there .
de mr president , madam vice president , today you are sitting on the other side .
there is no going back , either for you or for us .
on the operational headquarters it is not that I have changed my position .
the european institutions must come to an understanding on the eeas .
applause 
single euro payments area vote 
this is why we voted against .
he strongly encourages the european commission to establish a public and transparent dialogue on acta .
simplifying the accounting obligations for smes , and particularly for the smallest ones , remains an urgent requirement .
let us hope that the eu 2020 strategy will provide it .
the myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them .
the greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity .
this strategy must generate the creation of jobs .
in this context , the objective of european territorial cohesion can be seen to be fundamental .
i hope the process of lasting peace through a two state solution will be supported by the goldstone findings .
parliament is calling on the commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project .
public administrationsmigration to sepa is below our expectations .
it is a catastrophic violation of individual private property .
regrettably , the commission's information policy in relation to the negotiations leaves a lot to be desired .
europe is divided on this issue .
the militarisation of international relations and internal security on the basis of the aforementioned fight against terrorism 
i am delighted that the european parliament has clearly adopted the report on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons .
neither the uk nor france , nor indeed the us , now produce fissile material for weapons .
the eu will certainly not be planting its flag on the seabed , as the russians have done .
mr president , there are many good reasons for discussing the arctic .
however , we already know all this .
above all , it is necessary to deal with the unregulated legal status of the arctic region .
written statements rule 149 
applause 
as is the case for any prisoner , the state was responsible for his safety and for his life .
what is happening with the persecution in the western sahara ?
no ! we will not be part of this hypocrisy .
we know there are different ways to freedom for people oppressed by dictators .
the major democratic states and the eu should , of course , support this .
at the same time , constructive dialogues that started in 2008 are also giving positive signs .
those relations or any problems that there may be are settled in the independent courts of the spanish state .
this is the aim of the initiative presented by 12 european union governments .
we have the feeling that developments in this regard are going backwards rather than forwards .
i will now set out the main elements of the draft conclusions .
the only way out is to set clear priorities .
in some cases there are appalling stories of late payments by the eu itself .
in copenhagen , hungary and poland agreed to use these sums for green infrastructures .
the first is nuclear just the word , merely broaching the subject , frightens us .
what undertakings are there from the member states ?
the next issue is the sources of finance and the road maps .
you know that , during my previous mandate , I fought very hard for a european research area .
global climate warming caused by human activity is a fact .
fifty three people died , a dozen people are unaccounted for , and hundreds of people have lost their homes .
this is damage on a significant scale .
the european union must show its solidarity , but it must also demonstrate a sense of responsibility .
however , I must make a severe criticism of the european union solidarity fund .
the frequency and intensity of disastrous events is clearly increasing , and this is worrying .
as soon as news of the earthquake broke , echo's emergency response system was mobilised .
therefore we join with today's parliament motions calling for his release .
this situation needs to be amended as soon as possible .
we have to understand that without international involvement , mexico will not win the war .
therefore we cannot share the concerns of the mexican authorities , the agents of which regularly violate human rights .
the violence in mexico is linked to drug trafficking and the social inequalities made worse by the economic crisis .
they are the same people who are fighting to defend the rule of law and democracy .
if the president of the country declares war in this area , he should be given complete support .
fi mr president , I wish to highlight two issues in our resolution on mexico .
this barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world .
i hope this decision will not affect the number of sentences passed .
this is now the second ruling of the court with the same content .
morality , deterrence and fairness are key in the debate on the death penalty .
voting time
we had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order .
for those tasks , the fresh and forceful backing of the european parliament is of great importance .
in other words , yes , europe must show solidarity with greece .
if we do not want to see a large scale conflagration , we need now to demonstrate solidarity with greece .
leading the union means seeking a solution for greece .
el madam president , I think we have dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of greece .
in the final analysis , it is humiliating to have to resort to slogans .
how much of the structural funds ?
nobody has asked for money to be put on the table .
we must put an end to this now , and hopefully we shall do so tomorrow .
we have seen the results .
these are not the leadership skills that we need in the european union .
that is why I am in favour of this major , strong currency .
today , the debate revolves around greece tomorrow it will probably concern another member state .
both are needed when you belong to a family such as a euro area .
the greek people are paying a heavy price .
we must now acknowledge that that was a major mistake .
a single currency for such a large , economically heterogeneous region of the world is self evidently problematic .
this would be an unrealistic target for a number of european states .
this is a time that requires solidarity between the member states and europe's institutions .
it is to be hoped that the upcoming european council will take steps towards achieving integrated and coordinated solidarity .
the economic and financial crisis , and greece , require european action .
a detailed examination of the operation of the credit default swaps market is needed .
for that reason , particular attention must be given to the drawing up of the 2020 strategy .
in my view , however , nuclear power is little suited to leading europe into a sustainable energy future .
let us tackle what the citizens are asking us head on .
we must find the optimal solution the appropriate balance between different rules and common requirements .
parliament should work together with the commission to evaluate and give opinions on initiatives which are submitted .
it is extremely important that the treaties are complied with .
generally speaking , it is a fact that democracy is today taking a backwards step .
secondly , I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step .
europe as a whole has become even less of a single people than it might otherwise have been .
mr kamall is not here .
i hope that we will find the right balance on how to keep this admissibility check in adequate proportion .
the eu position does not leave any room for misinterpretation .
from our side , I can guarantee the eu's wholehearted support to such a process .
a month ago , I went to dharamsala and I met the dalai lama .
reference was also made here to the fact that we need a special representative for tibet .
this is embarrassing .
since that time , tibetans have not been allowed to commemorate that day freely .
in eastern europe , where I come from , the story is a familiar one .
however , what we are talking about here is more than that .
would it not be better to improve the services provided in biarritz by introducing non polluting forms of transport ?
you see , this is the genius of the eu it is always one person removed .
we are fighting with all the workers to create .
after all , staffing in all the union's institutions is managed according to this principle .
when the citizens of the union write to the commission , their letters must not go unanswered .
young people are already the driving force and future of europe .
we must protect the development cooperation budget , however hard that may be .
we cannot rise adequately to the daily challenges , or even to the annual challenges except with difficulty .
i would like to speak for a few more minutes about the cohesion policy .
as he knows , we will be doing that from september onwards .
my second point is about savings .
however , this can , certainly , be changed , but it requires significant outlays .
young people with degrees are increasingly affected by unemployment .
however , it is also vitally important to increase the funding for erasmus mundus grants .
however , I must point out that there are some elements of this report which I do not support .
regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard .
therefore , let us focus on quality and not packaging units .
the focus on quality rather than quantity may entail long term benefits for many households .
this robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers .
you are right about that .
this is all very welcome .
a person is infected by tuberculosis somewhere in the world every second .
this underestimates the way in which it is spreading , especially in central and eastern europe .
the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation short presentation 
one common feature is the increase in the financing needs of many countries .
theladies in whiteare mothers and wives of imprisoned opposition activists .
to ensure such a role , we still need to improve the functioning of financial systems considerably further .
we in the euro area must not penalise the countries that export the most .
but if we just look at the expenditure side , we will not succeed .
hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
thank you , sir .
this should be an important criterion for future assessments of other measures taken by the central bank .
this , too , does not necessarily have a deficit trigger .
it is already crumbling before our eyes .
this is no longer a market economy , but a jungle economy .
pl mr president , I shall avoid the military language which the previous speaker used .
the economic situation in numerous countries is clearly negative .
financial assistance for greece should come primarily from the international monetary fund imf .
it is really up to the council now to make a move .
i would like to draw attention to one aspect of it .
welcome
we warmly welcome mr tabarki and the members of his delegation .
otherwise , the interpretation made by the house's services will defeat the whole object of the reform .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting see minutes
the causes of this situation are varied .
unfortunately , the economic crisis is not yet over , and we cannot ignore it .
this does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child .
written explanations of vote
solidarity , because it is the raison d être of european integration and will be its future .
the crisis has ruthlessly laid bare the weaknesses of the common currency system .
a number of opinions were heard that opposed anypunishmentagainst mr fazakas .
tens of millions of eastern europeans still live a life troubled by the communist horrors .
the perpetrators of the communist indignity should not be part of a democratic order they tried to suppress .
they must start by introducing their children and young people into the european school system .
investing in young people is investing in the future .
today , the danish social democrats voted in favour of the priorities for the 2011 budget .
they must not result in dependency , which could have negative effects on growth , salaries and employment .
the most serious financial and economic crisis since the 1930s has hit europe hard .
traditional development aid has largely failed in its purpose .
we are still waiting for the results of these actions .
the two coming years will be difficult .
the right arrangements have been made to involve the imf , within the framework of the euro area .
in doing so , we will of course respect the distribution of competences as provided for in the treaties .
europe 2020 is not about one level acting at the expense of the other .
this will be crucial to resolving the crisis .
let us look , primarily , at greece .
what does the council then do to europe 2020 ?
mr van rompuy , you mentioned that this was your first formal european council meeting .
the third thing we need is a bolder 2020 strategy .
turning to the europe 2020 initiative , we welcome the first tentative steps taken by the council .
june this year is much too late .
we are talking about a matter of the greatest importance .
this is not a revolutionary idea , nor was it my idea .
we had a discussion on the same day about the crisis in greece and some other points .
you have our support , but this strategy does need to contain clear objectives on poverty .
the regional and local levels of european governance are important co owners of europe's future .
the commission needs to clarify the flow of information with greece .
this is an issue which is different from supporting greece .
i would like to answer telegraphically some of those questions .
should we discuss this within the task force ?
the summit had optimistic and promising significance .
documents received see minutes
it is nice for you to congratulate us for being here today .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
thus , it was not a point of order .
we might disagree on some specific questions but our objectives are the same .
we will need to remind ourselves of this again and again .
there are some areas where further action is necessary .
we need to think that one through .
of course , this does not need to influence safety .
further development is also important for us .
this is a real burning issue for me , and I would expect you to answer it .
that has been achieved with the help of the commission and also with the member states and the industry .
we require the travel agents to inform orally and / or in writing passengers at the time of reservation .
this is unacceptable .
it is not about earnings and not about profits it is about security .
i would suggest that you place this sort of thing in between the reports .
i am talking about the more stringent measures , which should be financed by the member states .
she cannot be here today .
the level of these charges should correspond only to costs demonstrably incurred in securing the safety of passengers .
what is clear is that the ash cloud has only delayed the pilotsstrike which has been announced .
we should therefore not start too high .
second , I would like to address the council and make an appeal to them .
roads are the arteries of our economy .
that is something on which we all agree .
this means efficient , safe , secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport services .
maritime transport provides for high quality jobs in europe and fuels research and european industrial innovation .
mr van dalen , congratulations on this excellent report .
in other words , we must counteract the risk of deflagging .
i am sure we will have to come back to this at a later stage .
i should like to refer to three specific questions .
finally , the concept ofgreen ports, as some members have dubbed it .
i have placed particular emphasis on shipbuilding and maintenance of ships .
this issue resonates differently in the various european countries .
european legislation on this matter must be rigorously applied , as mrs paulsen's report recommends .
we have a policy that limits greenhouse gas emissions .
de mr president , I , too , would like to thank mr dorfmann for his report .
an important question is how to maintain agricultural production in less favoured areas .
firstly , we should ensure that the requirements made of the industry are proportionate to the risk assessed .
this will enable the farmers to spend more time on their core agricultural activities .
the remaining information will be given in the e mail , which will reach you before lunch at the latest .
quite a number of matters were decided .
disruption of air traffic in europe debate 
we were very happy that eurocontrol was cooperative .
concerning passengers , the most important thing is to get people back home or to their destinations .
we must take a lesson from this for the future .
ultimately , it does not matter under which rules planes are flying or under which rules they are crashing .
these policies have focused entirely on air transport .
however , a human life is worth much more than goods .
the individual countries made the right decision .
it is a good idea to list the various possibilities , but we need a european approach .
where would we be today if we had implemented the provisions of the so called delors plan ?
we must also put more emphasis on accommodation .
passenger safety must be our overriding concern .
one of the biggest problems facing the passengers today is the confusion .
currently in europe , it is not possible to buy a train ticket in a civilised manner .
we are dealing with exceptional circumstances here , of course .
let us therefore be consistent .
if one thing is clear , it is that our society is extremely vulnerable to crises of this kind .
we want passengers from europe to be transported safely .
if we are all able to convince our parties , the situation will improve in future .
we are being far too polite .
thank you very much .
first , the urgent issues we recently debated the results of the european council .
the concerns and well being of european citizens will remain at the heart of commission action .
if this continues to be the case in the future , then these sorts of debates are pointless .
unfortunately , I cannot say the same thing about my fellow members .
it goes without saying that we must consolidate our budgets .
my next point relates to the budgetary consolidation .
we are talking here about the european social model that we want and that we love .
you will be able to rely on us if you finally put this into practice .
we therefore strongly support the centre piece initiative of this commission the 2020 strategy .
the commission must be their ally , not their adversary .
however , we do not have to take a laissez faire approach to economic forces .
therefore , we must firstly focus particular attention on the problem of poverty facing those in work .
they have to be given at the meeting of the council in june .
the increase in the employment rate is closely linked to the eu's industrial policy .
coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in haiti debate 
i will keep the european parliament constantly informed of the progress made on haiti reconstruction .
today , haiti needs 80 % of its export earnings to pay for its imported agricultural produce .
it is also the result of the domination and pillaging of haiti by many countries .
keep working towards that goal .
i believe that this can be put in place and could be successful .
the debate is closed .
question hour with the president of the commission
we discussed this in the college meeting today .
i do , however , admit that we have succeeded in some aspects .
so , we need genuine cooperation and support in that .
however , the region does not deserve this .
in bolivia , for example , approximately 60 % of the population live below the poverty line .
these events cannot simply be put on one side .
whether justifiably or not , this was obviously one of the causes of the clashes .
the same thing also applies to uzbekistan and to other countries .
written statements rule 149 
it is on that basis that we cooperate to protect our common interests .
the summit should also address the subject of reciprocal visa free travel .
no mention is made of the fact that canada did not play a particularly positive role in copenhagen .
they will need to be vigilant .
by 2020 , tar sand will probably have produced more emissions than austria and ireland .
however , it is important for us to find a middle way .
we should support the protection of intellectual property , but oppose blanket surveillance and persecution on the internet .
written statements rule 149 
this is the stage we are at .
de I welcome the fact that the commission is dealing with this subject from a competition perspective .
subject activity of credit rating agencies
el mr president , I thank the commissioner for his reply .
will we adopt await and seeapproach ?
it seems to me that these are , let us say , criteria which are possible to fulfil .
that is a real problem for me .
nevertheless , question time is scheduled until 8.30 on our agenda .
the commission intends to make full use of the new treaty instruments to achieve stronger policy coordination and governance .
the proposal that we are examining today therefore seems to be a breath of fresh air .
it has been said that in sweden , things are going very well .
that is not the same as an immigration policy , and people really should recognise the difference .
mrs krehl , who is replacing mr kirilov , has the floor .
the first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the structural funds .
the commission presented the first draft as long ago as july last year .
now let us turn to the future for a moment .
in these dark and overcast times , the kirilov report may be a breath of fresh air .
written statements rule 149 
the commission must not stop there , however .
therefore , this is a situation that we have seldom encountered on the european market .
in recent years , we have taken things too far with the removal of many of the market regulations .
but we are not out of the woods yet , so to speak .
i hope the commission is as concerned about this as members of parliament are .
the debates will be held from 09.00 to 13.00 and from 15.00 to 19.00 .
these actions must be highly effective , even under the most difficult circumstances .
this is an extremely large amount of money .
this is all good news , ladies and gentlemen .
obviously , amendments to the legal framework are also beginning to have an impact .
this is the guarantee of objectivity and the way to ensure compliance with international accounting rules and best practices .
the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats performs its work in full awareness of this responsibility .
fair is fair , however , and greater transparency is also needed in our own parliament .
commissioner šemeta , I would ask you to address this in your reply .
for that reason , I would like to propose eleven approaches to a solution .
unfortunately , that is not currently the case .
until progress is assessed , we also call for the freezing of funds to the annual level of 200here , we have the beginnings of a compromise .
rather support turkey's accession according to the accession criteria that the community itself has set .
having said that , there is still room for improvement .
my second request regards budgetary control .
in this regard , we urge the commission to produce recommendations on drafting these management statements .
i would like to reject that suspicion .
i fully share your views and the views of other members who talked about this issue .
action has been taken and clear and precise rules introduced in this field , too .
however , there is still room for improvement . significant improvement , I would say .
as a result , we have a detailed draft mandate from the commission .
here , I again have to make clear what other experts and even the investigative authorities have said repeatedly .
such an agreement mixes together innocent citizens with those who may be guilty .
the european parliament will be consistent with the positions it has always held .
one of the trickier complications has been the issue of people's legitimate right to personal privacy .
of course , that will not be part of the negotiation .
this can be discussed .
this house has always been highly critical of the use and transfer of pnr data .
therefore , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of this resolution for her work on this dossier .
the standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution .
that happened last year before christmas .
however , those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand .
unfortunately , there are .
we do not accept what the commission representative has said about there being no safe techniques .
there are practices and experiences from other countries with tragic results .
in addition , there is not even any european legislation on air quality for such emissions .
however , as we have heard , it is highly dangerous .
the subject before us is a very curious matter .
since 1990 , there have been some thirty cases worldwide of serious pollution caused by cyanide mining .
order of business
wednesday , 5 may 2010 
2008 discharge european training foundation
with the lisbon treaty in place , it is time for a review of the discharge process itself .
we all want to make sure that greece can overcome the problems from the past .
it noted , however , that certain aspects of the public procurement process could be improved .
that is why I voted for the report on the european agency for safety and health at work .
for these reasons , this proposal is to be welcomed .
i voted resolutely in favour of this text .
however , the commission was obliged to recast it , since the annex has been slightly amended .
the request for equal treatment for the outermost regions must be heard .
it is estimated that they will be finalised by the end of next year .
even in times of crisis let us fight for equal conditions in equivalent situations !
the rapporteur , mr szájer , rejects both national expert groups and the involvement of national authorities .
the democratic movement delegation welcomes the adoption of strategic goals for the eu's maritime transport until 20it must be realised that the european maritime sector mainly operates and competes in a global market .
the eu is the most significant global exporter and the second biggest importer .
in addition , particular attention needs to be given to protecting intellectual property rights .
the success of the project will depend to a large extent on the continued financial commitment of member states .
clearly , european agriculture must play a major role in combating climate change .
i am resolutely confident that the cap will become more sustainable over time .
that is why I voted for the report on the commission and executive agencies .
i therefore abstained during the final vote .
the european parliament has expressed its stance on this matter on a number of occasions .
european environmental legislation enshrines the precautionary principle and requires the prevention and monitoring of water pollution .
we hope that the member states will stop supporting mining projects using cyanide based technologies .
on behalf of the european parliament , I offer condolences and expressions of sympathy to the victimsfamilies .
parliament responds that there is no need .
my group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle .
the ball is therefore back in the council's court .
thisphantomsituation will certainly not do much for citizensconfidence in the eu .
greece will undertake painful efforts , but we all know that there are no alternatives to such efforts .
we need responsible behaviour from all our market players .
they must not become detached from their economic and societal function .
will this argument be taken up by the commission ?
greece rather , mr papandreou is not being given the time to achieve a consensus in greece .
ladies and gentlemen , we are held captive by the theory of the ever closer union .
anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt .
it will have to be implemented and applied through the national reform programmes .
we have decided on a set plan , new energy technology .
let us remember what happened to the services directive in this chamber .
for us poles , whom I represent here , the wordsolidarityhas great significance .
we have provided no clarification with regard to the future development of the european union .
that is not a criticism , either .
they then set out bold objectives and try to convince people that everything really will be better this time .
there are many indications that the utopian and socialist 2020 project will share the fate of the lisbon strategy .
it is simply a question of carrying out this planning .
it was with great sadness that I learnt of the deaths in greece it is very sad .
women , people aged over 45 and young people continue to have the most difficulty in finding work .
now there is a legal basis for the accession becoming a reality .
this question has been posed by our colleagues here and , yes , we do need it .
i remember as a student reading joseph weiler's articles about the protection of human rights .
written statements rule 149 
however , standards are only one of the instruments for helping industry .
many of the issues that I wanted to mention have already been raised here .
standardisation of vehicles and ensuring their universal operability in the european market is essential .
my country , the netherlands , has made a choice .
first of all , we lack a proper communications strategy .
electric vehicles help renewable energies , which have a weak spot they are irregular .
she raised the issue of lithium , along with other meps who have spoken about batteries during this debate .
consideration must be given to these struggles and the worsening of exploitation must stop .
it is time to respect the dignity of those who work and create wealth .
jobbik believes that it is possible to rid political life of corruption .
the leaders of european states pretend that nothing is going on .
the irregularity rate for the eu funds paid out has never been as low as in this year .
it is unacceptable to give eu funds to third countries without any established indicators .
this regulation was adopted in 200this regulation will expire on 31 may 20parliament is concerned about this reform .
fourthly , they need investment security , in other words contractual protection and no more revisions .
they need to be able to make safe investments over a long period .
i mean everybody's opinions , including yours , of course .
the debate is closed .
the second key word in the report is inequality , and several types of inequality at that .
some actions will build on the result of the good work done so far .
the commission stands ready to provide all the necessary support .
this is something we must especially ensure accessibility to medicines that come onto the market .
thus we have never before lent so much to countries such as hungary , lithuania and romania .
i would like to know is this the case ?
without doubt , the current economic crisis has highlighted the important work of the european investment bank .
i do not want anything to do with a person of this kind .
now it is crucially important that all the national parliaments finalise their decisions soon .
mr hans peter martin has asked for the floor due to personal allusions .
the best way for this is to simplify the complicated bureaucracy and create clear procedures .
secondly , it must bring the perpetrators to justice .
we have done this at the last minute , but we have responded to the needs of our citizens .
de mr president , animal welfare is indivisible .
it must be standardised and we need a global definition of it .
mrs mcguinness , thank you , and many greetings to your visitorsgroup .
i could not support this report on that basis , and I warn colleagues about its implications .
this in itself is quite understandable since health affects all of us and those closest to us .
we understand your concerns .
the united states needs europe , and I respectfully submit that europe needs the united states .
as you said , listen and talk to each other .
the exceptional circumstances fully justify the exceptional solutions adopted .
meanwhile , bakiyev fled the country to seek refuge in kazakhstan .
in europe 380 000 businesses are involved in motor vehicle distribution and services .
all measures intended to fight cancer and minimise its effects should be supported .
there must be greater political coordination by member states in these areas .
therefore , the idea to create a climate change monitoring platform would seem to be a good one .

the debate on the bauer report will be postponed until the next part session .
thursday
that is what I wanted to talk to you about .
in the islands I hail from , it is the main industry .
we should not ignore this reality we should recognise it .
should we abolish interest ?
the code of silence must end here .
it was finally issued by the spanish presidency , which has demonstrated exceptional tact and perseverance .
their work is of just as much benefit to the economy as the work of an employee .
they therefore have the same right to social protection as the state accords to employees .
however , in looking for suitable mechanisms for this protection , we must fully respect the principle of subsidiarity .
this must also come from the enterprises themselves , however .
the next step must be to provide paternity leave , too , so that we can ensure genuine equality .
europe's campaign to protect women is making headway with this text .
pt madam president , this directive needs to be reviewed urgently .
the member states will also have a clear obligation to grant social protection to assisting spouses , on request .
i therefore believe that these members could , in good conscience , vote for the other amendments .
a separate article was introduced , along with several recitals and provisions concerning funding related aspects .
it must not benefit industry alone .
it follows that the uk independence party regards this report with suspicion .
this proposal started off as mainly technical and non political and was just a means to bring three directives together .
all too often , newspaper stories have drawn our attention to cases of allergies in children and women .
we consider it essential to simplify standards and achieve greater legal certainty .
this evaluation is a prerequisite for any legislative initiative on the matter .
it states that only four per cent of overseas development aid is dedicated to agriculture .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
the treaty of lisbon has a direct or indirect effect on all of the european parliament's services .
via handshakes , like knows like , shadowy deals in back rooms , tens of millions are added to the budget .
the elite decides , and the public coughs up .
the committee on budgetary control will do everything in its power to point out where things are not working .
these institutions are clearly expanding their activities , with greater powers and a greater workload .
the vote tomorrow is very timely for the sis ii project .
such a scheme would merely encourage more refugees , genuine or not , to come to the european union .
of course , we might wish that this work could be more effective and more successful .
we are preparing for a hopefully successful milestone 2 test on sis later this autumn .
i am going to talk about the canary islands .
i am thinking about numerous products tomatoes , bananas , and the livestock sector .
some decisions will even be applied retroactively .
milk is the azoresmain agricultural product .
the energy performance of buildings recast 
equal treatment between self employed men and women 
we also insisted on the importance of parliament being kept duly informed about the actual implementation of the assistance .
it seems to me this will make more sense .
oral explanations of vote
furthermore , energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30 % over conventional buildings .
these texts also stipulate that energy saving must be a fundamental element in the renovation of buildings .
this directive represents an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
it is for that reason that I voted against this report .
i therefore support the setting up of a fund at european level .
the report on the schengen information system and its modernisation contributes to this magnificent breakthrough in free intra european movement .
the latter wishes to take refugeesnationality as the basis for deciding who has priority to be resettled .
do we have to receive all of them in our countries , on the orders of this organisation ?
that is a long term struggle , but it is something worth fighting for .
we must invest we must provide certainties , offer opportunities .
we must redouble our efforts we must put young people at the centre of our european policies .
there are definitely more problems than those I have mentioned .
we owe it to the future generation of europeans .
for these reasons , the ecr group has abstained on amendments 1 in my opinion , this is essential information that must always be communicated to the consumer .
the macro financial assistance for ukraine is the first case to be decided under the new procedure .
farmers have always been the most ardent and steadfast supporters of european union integration .
i am in favour of the report submitted .
that is exactly what we want for the new cap .
farmers do not need more eu direct support they need fairer prices for their products .
by endorsing this document , we have given expression to our determination over simplification of the common agricultural policy .
furthermore , clarification is still required for questions including public private partnerships , town planning and service concessions .
i applaud the rapporteur for his work and am voting in favour of this .
i fully recognise the importance of eu development policy and of assistance to developing countries .
consequently , in the name of general safety , we need to ensure compliance with these regulations .
the next item is the joint debate on 
i fully share parliament's concern as regards combating organ trafficking .
let me also raise another issue adopting a law is the first step .
however , I am even more pleased that this is a topic which is genuinely european .
of course , we must be extremely vigilant as regards the issue of illegal organ trafficking .
the basque country euskadi has the world record for organ donation .
as I understand it , these two systems still coexist in member states .
de madam president , I have followed this debate very closely .
the directive will provide a comparable safety standard across the union and increased trust in transplantation systems .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 may 20 the sitting was suspended at 16.25 and resumed at 16.30 
this is a regrettable loophole that should be removed from the rome statute .
free speech will always be sacrificed because that is the eu's default position .
it will be very difficult to explain to our citizens which court is the right one for their complaint .
at the moment , there are several dozen towns in northern hungary that are entirely under water .
we will do that systematically in all our discussions with partners outside of europe .
this action plan is a guide for very concrete measures to be taken during the next five years .
our citizens demand and deserve better protection against terrorism and against organised or trans border crime .
the arrest warrant ms ludford was just speaking about this .
it is going to be on your table .
unfortunately , too often , copyright is presented as an obstacle to the creation of a single digital market .
i am thinking about a european definition of orphan works .
subject european sme week
the greatest challenge being faced by small and medium sized enterprises at the present is securing capital and funding .
will question 33 , in part 3 , be taken ?
moreover , this is another stain on our current model of european integration .
it rests with the local authorities and regional institutions to help such people as quickly as possible .
we want and we need to move away from this oil based society .
we cannot put up with a similar situation here .
i think that here , too , we should take the lead and set a good example .
in other words , does there always have to be an accident before we learn anything ?
was it human error ?
i will therefore be speaking on his behalf this evening .
unfortunately , there is no intention of this happening .
perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely .
i will now move on to my final question .
as a consequence , I believe we should draw some conclusions from this relatively critical situation .
i know that we cannot fight the elements .
this was said by a famous spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost .
the necessary penalty proceedings must naturally follow .
they seem to apply a more measured approach and I believe that we could perhaps learn something there .
i have no doubt that the commissioner , who is with us this evening , will spearhead this .
the role of eurocontrol must also be closely examined .
i must ask you to continue working to this end .
this applies to both right wing and left wing governments .
my group is asking europe to wake up .
therefore , we need economic governance and we also ultimately need the strength to implement our own regulations .
i would like to say , mrs sinclaire , that I am watching the time .
mr president , the council was unanimous let us also show that kind of unanimity .
you spoke today about the reform of the labour market and the pension system .
fr mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yes , we need responsible public spending .
the structural problem of ours has been that public overspending went on for too long .
the president cut off the speaker 
in any case , the eu always takes the opportunity .
this would really just mean going from bad to worse .
political strengthening is not being followed by the appropriate financial strengthening .
but it is also time to look around and see what other actions are contributing to the recent turmoil .
these may include increased euroscepticism and uncertainty among those countries that are preparing to enter the euro area .
noli me tangere touch me not !
ten pages sounds short , but it is full of concrete initiatives .
this is heavy stuff , which is what we need in europe .
none of the member states is able to mount effective resistance to global threats on its own .
after the vote 
today is a great day for european citizens and for european patients .
my group's amendment aims to move the strasbourg week from week 10 to week that does not prevent you from holding a plenary session on the second tuesday in march .
before the vote 
mr president , the commissioner informed us just before the vote about the thrombin issue .
if you hadn't done so , it would probably be the case that we would be still here .
is it really the job of politicians to manage our food ?
therefore , I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case .
that is not the case .
in this case , the question is related to the electricity used and its efficiency .
it will establish the fulcrum of an integrated and sustainable policy from an environmental standpoint .
for the reasons I have stated , I commend the rapporteur and express my agreement .
i voted for the draft directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation .
issues relating to the diet and health of citizens are extremely sensitive and must be considered carefully and objectively .
i will vote in favour of the approval of this substance only if we impose a clear labelling requirement .
in romania , 13 people on the transplant waiting list die every day due to the lack of donors .
this could be our chance to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of eu citizens .
this needs to change .
we are talking about the direction , and also about implementation in the near future .
when we talk about europe 2020 , what are we talking about ?
the citizens are our most important allies in achieving our joint objectives .
we cannot do this by convincing ourselves that we can keep following the same old tracks .
objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at european level and rightly so .
do we want to reduce the number of poor workers , of which there are nearly 17 million ?
el mr president , the current lisbon strategy has simply been renamed europe 2020 strategy .
let us build on a foundation of nation states .
we must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector , including both small scale manufacturers and retailers .
we therefore need a minimum framework of disincentives for redundancy .
we need to clarify certain points .
this is not an appeal to postpone our actions in the field of public finances .
i am not implying anything of the sort .
that the market must be reassured .
who is the market , though ?
how much longer do people have to endure this cynical approach ?
all of this earns its rightful place in the europe 2020 strategy .
investing in it bears no risk .
we absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation .
are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis ?
it would also make the eu 2020 strategy relevant to individuals and citizens right across europe .
greece is not taking money from other nations .
secondly , we already have high government deficits .
now it is time to save .
however , there are a number of areas which I would be concerned about .
no one can assess its long term consequences at this stage .
research can also build bridges between universities and business .
this report reflects outdated and failed thinking .
i wish to thank mr pál schmitt , who is presently speaker of the hungarian parliament .
universities can also contribute to training the smesstaff as part of the lifelong learning process .
i , too , wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
after all , business does not set itself such an objective .
as a romanian mep , I have even more interest in this particular issue of the kozloduy nuclear plant .
or can anyone else see any reason in it ?
i wanted to demonstrate the fact that we are capable of listening .
i must say to you , however , that your speech seemed entirely improper to me .
when shutting down part of the power plant , its staff will face new challenges .
since 2004 , political contacts have increased in profile and intensity .
all that is left are the dreams of thousands of people , many of whom died as refugees .
the union for the mediterranean is not , of course , the framework for addressing regional conflicts .
i am convinced that growth of the union can reinforce the unity of europe .
this is principally because of the problems relating to belarusparticipation .
however , the ufm does , nonetheless , face certain political tensions .
in the kirilov report , we are choosing the second of these two options .
we urgently need a peaceful solution in nagorno karabakh and in the occupied azerbaijani areas .
frankly speaking , it is a step which certainly is overdue .
we finished the conference 10 minutes ago .
the aim of the rapporteur and of the 250 other members is to destroy the economy .
however , if we fail to do this , the whole of europe will go bankrupt !
high debt and deficit levels are a grave concern to the uk and across many member states .
how can that be ?
why am I mentioning this ?
this is the root of all the misunderstanding .
i voted for the schmitt report to encourage cooperation between universities and companies .
in writing . I supported this report on the union for the mediterranean ufm .
i believe that the interests of european and mediterranean citizens should always take precedence over those of the financiers .
nevertheless , much needs to be done along the road towards genuine religious freedom in pakistan .
i am going to take four speakers .
the united states of america has been a lot more active than the european union in this matter .
the vote will take place shortly .
the promotion of tolerance is the key to protecting religious minorities in pakistan .
however , to ensure this happens , we need moderation because democracy cannot prevail through violence .
these people are very critical of their unfair treatment and lack of rights .
i would therefore like to express my sympathy with those who have lost family members .
burma is going to hold an election this year for the first time in 30 years .
unfortunately , the election laws published do not provide for fair and free elections .
although improvements have been made in individual cases , the human rights situation in burma remains extremely poor .
we welcome the tone of this resolution calling for increased economic sanctions .
the report by mr quintana , the united nations special rapporteur , is very clear .
that , I am afraid , is the problem , but your comments have been noted .

what does this mean in practice ?
there are some concerns around agriculture .
my second point concerns the question of gaza .
i would like to endorse what mr färm said about youth policy and the promotion of young people .
that is very important .
i think those were the only factual matters .
commissioner lewandowski promised us a budget focusing on young people and education .
unfortunately , the actual financial support proposed does not meet the expectations of the european parliament .
so we have an interesting debate tonight .
it is by no means perfect , but provides a basis for progress .
what are these mdgs ?
in my view , we have come full circle .
and this we should also take into account when designing the external action service .
the millennium development goals should and can be achieved , and I say this with full responsibility .
it has been an interesting debate .
its main objective must be to promote the autonomy , independence and initiative of the relevant countries .
i firmly believe that the needs of the market will highlight the benefit of these investments .
pointless large scale projects , coupled with a refusal to face reality , will only gobble up money .
we certainly need this .
the reason was mentioned by commissioner reding greater economic activity and a greater concentration of land transport .
that is why I warmly welcome the agreement reached by the two co legislators .
in fact , the procedure was extremely difficult .
i am pleased we are debating and voting this directive this week , still under the spanish presidency .
i say to ukip that there is no call to get nationalistic about the quality of justice .
the vote will take place on wednesday 16 june 20written statements rule 149 
as has been stated in the past , it demonstrates a lack of respect for parliament .
we would be truly lost .
the council will also take its decision without any political benefit .
this sort of logic should also be applied in the event of euro area enlargement .
they prepared the ground , in fact , for today's euro crisis .
the romanian government has issued an emergency ordinance banning dozens of such substances .
romania is fortunate because it has noticed the rise in this phenomenon in good time .
the very first legal act of the new hungarian parliament was an act on dual citizenship .
the majority of us support eurostat's extended powers and the increased opportunities for inspection .
the cost of running these pools would amount to perhaps eur 1 million per year .
this is a timely report that is of a high quality and that is economically and politically important .
personally , mr langen , I am in favour of such an approach .
this is also a very important issue on which we must continue to work .
in addition , we are , indeed , dealing here with a classic question of recognition .
i warmly welcome the european parliament's intention to participate again this year with a strong delegation .

it is a treaty that seeks the closest possible union .
the efforts made by all spanish authorities have also been crucial .
the first is the european citizensinitiative .
in the closing phases , however , it was the presidency that made the decisive contribution .
i have the following to say to the president of the commission .
that means you can already mothball 20we are always saying we want growth , growth , growth .
i believe that after six months . well , we will have to see after the next few presidencies .
we should have the clarity of mind to discuss this problem in the future .
that is the plain truth .
the speaker agrees to answer the question of another member in accordance with rule 149 8 
we could still do that too , mr schulz .
on several occasions , we have missed the council at question time in strasbourg .
we now have a social nightmare of mass unemployment and a tax on living standards across europe .
unfortunately , not a great deal of this proved possible to achieve .
from the start .
we have felt close to this institution , although , at times , there have been harsh voices .
spain has set an example .
once again , I would like to thank the spanish presidency and mr zapatero .
this means that we have the possibility of revisiting this afresh , without surprising anyone or damaging mutual interests .
internal european bank data transfers will also largely not be conducted via swift .
the new agreement was approved on 28 june 20article 18 is a good article .
this is a methodology we need to master .
one thousand five hundred dossiers have already been handed over in that way .
the rapporteur laid out the provisions that we will take .
by what right ?
the paris convention regulates the frequency , quality and organisational procedures of international exhibitions .
eu member states with access to the sea are already iczm members , however .
since this comes into conflict with considerations of subsidiarity , I voted against it .
interdisciplinary cooperation is needed here , including in the european parliament committees .
this report focuses on the contribution of eu regional policy to resolving the economic crisis .
however , it seemed preferable to me to abstain on amendment all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
i am pleased that it was adopted with a resounding majority .
this makes maritime goods transport less attractive and means that it is not used to the optimum extent .
the eu airline industry is already in dire straits .
it is crucial to have cleaner vehicles and more efficient transport systems in order to reduce this impact .
the european economy , and therefore employment , depends on the sustainable future of transport .
unfortunately , however , the finances allocated to this sector are inadequate .
that is why I voted as I did .
even if young people do find work , they are very often only given temporary contracts .
vocational training is indispensable .
this is almost double the average unemployment rate .
these have a greater impact on young people and women .
the european union is facing a major financial , economic and social crisis .
in writing . the report as adopted in committee has been adopted in plenary .
the report deals with the issue adequately , and I will vote in favour of its adoption .
reduction is one of the best ways of combating problems related to waste .
we have the institutions .
we are addressing this in our proposals , in particular , as regards the euro area .
applause 
this is the point of departure for the larosière exercise .
we need to arrive at consensus .
today , you are rushing us towards a social and political explosion .
that could only enhance the role of europe in this matter .
this leaves some leeway for reaching a compromise at a first reading within the next few weeks .
it is insisting that the fox should be put in charge of the henhouse .
first , there are the issues concerning efficiency .
let nobody be confused , however this is not a sign of weakness .
do not say one thing here and another there .
they will not be different but they will be balanced .
it is simply asking for european supervision for european actors and national supervision for national actors .
i can think of no other name for that than a political federation .
here lies the essence of the entire debate on financial architecture and the supervision of financial architecture .
the citizens sitting here and watching us may quite rightly ask so what is your solution ? 
in these troubled times , the european systemic risk board must get to work as quickly as possible .
they must not degenerate into empty shells which passively observe market developments .
the safeguard clause is an obstructive instrument and contravenes community solidarity .
we should be proud .
we have gone through full time , we are now in extra time .
in the meantime , the markets have done their job .
like you , I think that we must go further .
the next item is the joint debate on 
i think that we can go even further in this matter .
however , the future supervisory authority will be responsible for the interpretation .
so , work is now in progress .
el commissioner , thank you very much for your reply .
indeed we have been pushing for a debate on the mercosur bilateral talks .
i am very angry , quite frankly , about the way this has been done .
subject progress of democratisation in georgia and azerbaijan
on top of this , hundreds of local authorities are becoming fair trade towns .
i want to know if any assessment has been made .
can these things affect our health ?
i do not believe it is the latter .
a great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals .
we certainly do need it .
there is no reason , therefore , to have to fall back on meat from cloned animals .
there is no reliable evidence available to show what kind of suffering such animals endure .
absolutely not .
fifth , clarification of the fact that all food products containing nanomaterials require case by case authorisation by eu citizens .
in the light of this , I am truly disappointed with the course of the negotiations .
pl mr president , I would like to comment on two matters .
the president cut off the speaker 
all parties must therefore take responsibility for ensuring that no illegal timber is sold in the eu .
in my opinion , parliament has set an example of how it can operate and express its democratic power .
this illegal practice places sustainable timber exploitation and the companies involved in it at risk .
it is also important that we do not accord timber a status that is inferior to other materials .
there are options for bypassing even this system .
while it could still be improved , the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous .
cross border crisis management in the banking sector 
as far as cross compliance is concerned , I think that it has had a positive impact on direct payments .
it is also essential that we maintain the second pillar of the common agricultural policy .
however , I do not wish to prolong the debate .
what we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
two pillars absolutely , I agree with that .
europe has a particular responsibility to guarantee food safety in the world .
we thus provide for the possibility of a transitional period .
this undermines the sense of solidarity , equality and community .
in writing . de I thank the rapporteur .
can we get this parliament to work for the members of parliament , not for the administration of parliament ?
europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle .
how many tonnes of beef ?
the two are completely linked and therefore we need to understand what the impact will be .
agriculture is only one part of this macro agreement .
i believe that if we make the right choices it is possible to successfully conclude both negotiations .
do the agreements include a net exporter clause , in order to prevent the development of a trade triangle ?
the european commission has disregarded these developments .
will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessments ?
a commission that claims to act in the best interests of the citizens must do so .
on the one hand , my colleagues want to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy .
doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen .
i would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation .
this market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries .
i am sure that we will be able to vote at 12.i would like to say that we are taking care of all the concerns mentioned by the members .
fr let us calm down !
then they could determine the true view of parliament .
on this occasion , though , I believe we have got the balance right .
lv thank you , mr president .
the macedonian government has democratic legitimacy .
we must now work together to provide suitable financial resources for these political tasks .
noterror agreementrespects grassroots freedoms .
on the other hand , there is the protection of citizensrights .
timely coordination of the different areas of eu external policy by the commission is clearly important .
regrettably , children are the main victims of this type of explosive material .
farmers also provide food , which we need in order to live .
i voted in favour of the report by mr cadec .
it is an important step towards preventing global distortions of competition and supporting honest , law abiding fishermen .

applause 
judge afiuni's case is a sad reminder of venezuela's negative attitude towards human rights .
we are following the tendency of political polarisation re emerging in the country with concern .
what is currently happening here is appalling .
this should be one of the future topics of our discussions with china when we have our bilateral dialogue .
china must change its law to protect the victims of trafficking instead of returning them to north korea .
the negotiated text for this free trade agreement provides for the possibility of designating outward processing zones .
